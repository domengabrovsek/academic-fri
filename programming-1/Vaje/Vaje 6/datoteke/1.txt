whom at any given moment would have been utterly impossible since no written record and no spoken word ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one at this moment for example in if it was oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines actually as winston well knew it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control officially the change of partners had never happened oceania was at war with eurasia therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia the enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible the frightening thing he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward with hands on hips they were gyrating their bodies from the waist an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles the frightening thing was that it might all be true if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event it never happened that surely was more terrifying than mere torture and death the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia he winston smith knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four years ago but where did that knowledge exist only in his own consciousness which in any case must soon be annihilated and if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed if all records told the same tale then the lie passed into history and became truth who controls the past ran the party slogan controls the future who controls the present controls the past and yet the past though of its nature alterable never had been altered whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting it was quite simple all that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory reality control they called it in newspeak doublethink stand easy barked the instructress a little more genially winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself that was the ultimate subtlety consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed even to understand the word doublethink involved the use of doublethink the instructress had called them to attention again and now let s see which of us can touch our toes she said enthusiastically right over from the hips please comrades one two one two winston loathed this exercise which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit the half pleasant quality went out of his meditations the past he reflected had not merely been altered it had been actually destroyed for how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory he tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of big brother he thought it must have been at some time in the sixties but it was impossible to be certain in the party histories of course big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very earliest days his exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in great gleaming motor cars or horse carriages with glass sides there was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before but it was possible that in its oldspeak form english socialism that is to say it had been current earlier everything melted into mist sometimes indeed you could put your finger on a definite lie it was not true for example as was claimed in the party history books that the party had invented aeroplanes he remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood but you could prove nothing there was never any evidence just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact and on that occasion smith screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen smith w yes you bend lower please you can do better than that you re not trying lower please that s better comrade now stand at ease the whole squad and watch me a sudden hot sweat had broken out all over winston s body his face remained completely inscrutable never show dismay never show resentment a single flicker of the eyes could give you away he stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head and one could not say gracefully but with remarkable neatness and efficiency bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes there comrades that s how i want to see you doing it watch me again i m thirty nine and i ve had four children now look she bent over again you see my knees aren t bent you can all do it if you want to she added as she straightened herself up anyone under forty five is perfectly capable of touching his toes we don t all have the privilege of fighting in the front line but at least we can all keep fit remember our boys on the malabar front and the sailors in the floating fortresses just think what they have to put up with now try again that s better comrade that s much better she added encouragingly as winston with a violent lunge succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent for the first time in several years x x x with the deep unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day s work started winston pulled the speakwrite towards him blew the dust from its mouthpiece and put on his spectacles then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right hand side of his desk in the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices to the right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left a larger one for newspapers and in the side wall within easy reach of winston s arm a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating this last was for the disposal of waste paper similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor for some reason they were nicknamed memory holes when one knew that any document was due for destruction or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled each contained a message of only one or two lines in the abbreviated jargon not actually newspeak but consisting largely of newspeak words which was used in the ministry for internal purposes they ran times bb speech malreported africa rectify times forecasts yp th quarter misprints verify current issue times miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify times reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston laid the fourth message aside it was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last the other three were routine matters though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures winston dialled back numbers on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of the times which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes delay the messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter or as the official phrase had it to rectify for example it appeared from the times of the seventeenth of march that big brother in his speech of the previous day had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in north africa as it happened the eurasian higher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone it was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother s speech in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened or again the times of the nineteenth of december had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth three year plan today s issue contained a statement of the actual output from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong winston s job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones as for the third message it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes as short a time ago as february the ministry of plenty had issued a promise a categorical pledge were the official words that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during actually as winston was aware the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april as soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube then with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames what happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led he did not know in detail but he did know in general terms as soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the times had been assembled and collated that number would be reprinted the original copy destroyed and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers but to books periodicals pamphlets posters leaflets films sound tracks cartoons photographs to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date in this way every prediction made by the party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct nor was any item of news or any expression of opinion which conflicted with the needs of the moment ever allowed to remain on record all history was a palimpsest scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary in no case would it have been possible once the deed was done to prove that any falsification had taken place the largest section of the records department far larger than the one on which winston worked consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books newspapers and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction a number of the times which might because of changes in political alignment or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date and no other copy existed to contradict it books also were recalled and rewritten again and again and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made even the written instructions which winston received and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed always the reference was to slips errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy but actually he thought as he re adjusted the ministry of plenty s figures it was not even forgery it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head for example the ministry of plenty s forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at million pairs the actual output was given as sixty two millions winston however in rewriting the forecast marked the figure down to fifty seven millions so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled in any case sixty two millions was no nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions or than millions very likely no boots had been produced at all likelier still nobody knew how many had been produced much less cared all one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper while perhaps half the population of oceania went barefoot and so it was with every class of recorded fact great or small everything faded away into a shadow world in which finally even the date of the year had become uncertain winston glanced across the hall in the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small precise looking dark chinned man named tillotson was working steadily away with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite he had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen he looked up and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in winston s direction winston hardly knew tillotson and had no idea what work he was employed on people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs in the long windowless hall with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the two minutes hate he knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed there was a certain fitness in this since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier and a few cubicles away a mild ineffectual dreamy creature named ampleforth with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres was engaged in producing garbled versions definitive texts they were called of poems which had become ideologically offensive but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies and this hall with its fifty workers or thereabouts was only one sub section a single cell as it were in the huge complexity of the records department beyond above below were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs there were the huge printingshops with their sub editors their typography experts and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs there was the tele programmes section with its engineers its producers and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices there were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall there were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed and somewhere or other quite anonymous there were the directing brains who co ordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved that one falsified and the other rubbed out of existence and the records department after all was itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers films textbooks telescreen programmes plays novels with every conceivable kind of information instruction or entertainment from a statue to a slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and from a child s spelling book to a newspeak dictionary and the ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat there was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport crime and astrology sensational five cent novelettes films oozing with sex and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator there was even a whole sub section pornosec it was called in newspeak engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography which was sent out in sealed packets and which no party member other than those who worked on it was permitted to look at three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while winston was working but they were simple matters and he had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him when the hate was over he returned to his cubicle took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf pushed the speakwrite to one side cleaned his spectacles and settled down to his main job of the morning winston s greatest pleasure in life was in his work most of it was a tedious routine but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and your estimate of what the party wanted you to say winston was good at this kind of thing on occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the times leading articles which were written entirely in newspeak he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier it ran times reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling in oldspeak or standard english this might be rendered the reporting of big brother s order for the day in the times of december rd is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non existent persons rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing winston read through the offending article big brother s order for the day it seemed had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as ffcc which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the floating fortresses a certain comrade withers a prominent member of the inner party had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration the order of conspicuous merit second class three months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given one could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen that was to be expected since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced the great purges involving thousands of people with public trials of traitors and thought criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed were special show pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years more commonly people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were never heard of again one never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them in some cases they might not even be dead perhaps thirty people personally known to winston not counting his parents had disappeared at one time or another winston stroked his nose gently with a paper clip in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite he raised his head for a moment again the hostile spectacle flash winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself it was perfectly possible so tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person on the other hand to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that would re edit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross referencing that would be required and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth winston did not know why withers had been disgraced perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of a too popular subordinate perhaps withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies or perhaps what was likeliest of all the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government the only real clue lay in the words refs unpersons which indicated that withers was already dead you could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing this time for ever withers however was already an unperson he did not exist he had never existed winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brother s speech it was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought criminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumph of over production in the ninth three year plan might complicate the records too much what was needed was a piece of pure fantasy suddenly there sprang into his mind ready made as it were the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who had recently died in battle in heroic circumstances there were occasions when big brother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humble rankand file party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy it was true that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence winston thought for a moment then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in big brother s familiar style a style at once military and pedantic and because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them what lessons do we learn from this fact comrades the lesson which is also one of the fundamental principles of ingsoc that etc etc easy to imitate at the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum a sub machine gun and a model helicopter at six a year early by a special relaxation of the rules he had joined the spies at nine he had been a troop leader at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the junior anti sex league at nine teen he had designed a hand grenade which had been adopted by the ministry of peace and which at its first trial had killed thirtyone eurasian prisoners in one burst at twenty three he had perished in action pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the indian ocean with important despatches he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water despatches and all an end said big brother which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy big brother added a few remarks on the purity and single mindedness of comrade ogilvy s life he was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium and had taken a vow of celibacy believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty four hour a day devotion to duty he had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the hunting down of spies saboteurs thoughtcriminals and traitors generally winston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross referencing that it would entail once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle something seemed to tell him with certainty that tillotson was busy on the same job as himself there was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own comrade ogilvy unimagined an hour ago was now a fact it struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones comrade ogilvy who had never existed in the present now existed in the past and when once the act of forgery was forgotten he would exist just as authentically and upon the same evidence as charlemagne or julius caesar x x x in the low ceilinged canteen deep underground the lunch queue jerked slowly forward the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin on the far side of the room there was a small bar a mere hole in the wall where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip just the man i was looking for said a voice at winston s back he turned round it was his friend syme who worked in the research department perhaps friend was not exactly the right word you did not have friends nowadays you had comrades but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others syme was a philologist a specialist in newspeak indeed he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary he was a tiny creature smaller than winston with dark hair and large protuberant eyes at once mournful and derisive which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you i wanted to ask you whether you d got any razor blades he said not one said winston with a sort of guilty haste i ve tried all over the place they don t exist any longer everyone kept asking you for razor blades actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up there had been a famine of them for months past at any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shops were unable to supply sometimes it was buttons sometimes it was darning wool sometimes it was shoelaces at present it was razor blades you could only get hold of them if at all by scrounging more or less furtively on the free market i ve been using the same blade for six weeks he added untruthfully the queue gave another jerk forward as they halted he turned and faced syme again each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday said syme i was working said winston indifferently i shall see it on the flicks i suppose a very inadequate substitute said syme his mocking eyes roved over winston s face i know you the eyes seemed to say i see through you i know very well why you didn t go to see those prisoners hanged in an intellectual way syme was venomously orthodox he would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages and trials and confessions of thought criminals the executions in the cellars of the ministry of love talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him if possible in the technicalities of newspeak on which he was authoritative and interesting winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes it was a good hanging said syme reminiscently i think it spoils it when they tie their feet together i like to see them kicking and above all at the end the tongue sticking right out and blue a quite bright blue that s the detail that appeals to me nex please yelled the white aproned prole with the ladle winston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille on to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch a metal pannikin of pinkish grey stew a hunk of bread a cube of cheese a mug of milkless victory coffee and one saccharine tablet there s a table over there under that telescreen said syme let s pick up a gin on the way the gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs they threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metal topped table on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit winston took up his mug of gin paused for an instant to collect his nerve and gulped the oily tasting stuff down when he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry he began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew which in among its general sloppiness had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins from the table at winston s left a little behind his back someone was talking rapidly and continuously a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck which pierced the general uproar of the room how is the dictionary getting on said winston raising his voice to overcome the noise slowly said syme i m on the adjectives it s fascinating he had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak he pushed his pannikin aside took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting the eleventh edition is the definitive edition he said we re getting the language into its final shape the shape it s going to have when nobody speaks anything else when we ve finished with it people like you will have to learn it all over again you think i dare say that our chief job is inventing new words but not a bit of it we re destroying words scores of them hundreds of them every day we re cutting the language down to the bone the eleventh edition won t contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls then continued speaking with a sort of pedant s passion his thin dark face had become animated his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy it s a beautiful thing the destruction of words of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well it isn t only the synonyms there are also the antonyms after all what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word a word contains its opposite in itself take good for instance if you have a word like good what need is there for a word like bad ungood will do just as well better because it s an exact opposite which the other is not or again if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like excellent and splendid and all the rest of them plusgood covers the meaning or doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still of course we use those forms already but in the final version of newspeak there ll be nothing else in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words in reality only one word don t you see the beauty of that winston it was b b s idea originally of course he added as an afterthought a sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winston s face at the mention of big brother nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm you haven t a real appreciation of newspeak winston he said almost sadly even when you write it you re still thinking in oldspeak i ve read some of those pieces that you write in the times occasionally they re good enough but they re translations in your heart you d prefer to stick to oldspeak with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning you don t grasp the beauty of the destruction of words do you know that newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year winston did know that of course he smiled sympathetically he hoped not trusting himself to speak syme bit off another fragment of the dark coloured bread chewed it briefly and went on don t you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of thought in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express it every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten already in the eleventh edition we re not far from that point but the process will still be continuing long after you and i are dead every year fewer and fewer words and the range of consciousness always a little smaller even now of course there s no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime it s merely a question of self discipline reality control but in the end there won t be any need even for that the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect newspeak is ingsoc and ingsoc is newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction has it ever occurred to you winston that by the year at the very latest not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now except began winston doubtfully and he stopped it had been on the tip of his tongue to say except the proles but he checked himself not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox syme however had divined what he was about to say the proles are not human beings he said carelessly by earlier probably all real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared the whole literature of the past will have been destroyed chaucer shakespeare milton byron they ll exist only in newspeak versions not merely changed into something different but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be even the literature of the party will change even the slogans will change how could you have a slogan like freedom is slavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished the whole climate of thought will be different in fact there will be no thought as we understand it now orthodoxy means not thinking not needing to think orthodoxy is unconsciousness one of these days thought winston with sudden deep conviction syme will be vaporized he is too intelligent he sees too clearly and speaks too plainly the party does not like such people one day he will disappear it is written in his face winston had finished his bread and cheese he turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee at the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away a young woman who was perhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her back to winston was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said from time to time winston caught some such remark as i think you re so right i do so agree with you uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice but the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl was speaking winston knew the man by sight though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the fiction department he was a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and a large mobile mouth his head was thrown back a little and because of the angle at which he was sitting his spectacles caught the light and presented to winston two blank discs instead of eyes what was slightly horrible was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word just once winston caught a phrase complete and final elimination of goldsteinism jerked out very rapidly and as it seemed all in one piece like a line of type cast solid for the rest it was just a noise a quackquack quacking and yet though you could not actually hear what the man was saying you could not be in any doubt about its general nature he might be denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought criminals and saboteurs he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army he might be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabar front it made no difference whatever it was you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy pure ingsoc as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy it was not the man s brain that was speaking it was his larynx the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words but it was not speech in the true sense it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness like the quacking of a duck syme had fallen silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew the voice from the other table quacked rapidly on easily audible in spite of the surrounding din there is a word in newspeak said syme i don t know whether you know it duckspeak to quack like a duck it is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it is abuse applied to someone you agree with it is praise unquestionably syme will be vaporized winston thought again he thought it with a kind of sadness although well knowing that syme despised him and slightly disliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought criminal if he saw any reason for doing so there was something subtly wrong with syme there was something that he lacked discretion aloofness a sort of saving stupidity you could not say that he was unorthodox he believed in the principles of ingsoc he venerated big brother he rejoiced over victories he hated heretics not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal an up to dateness of information which the ordinary party member did not approach yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him he said things that would have been better unsaid he had read too many books he frequented the chestnut tree cafe haunt of painters and musicians there was no law not even an unwritten law against frequenting the chestnut tree cafe yet the place was somehow ill omened the old discredited leaders of the party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged goldstein himself it was said had sometimes been seen there years and decades ago syme s fate was not difficult to foresee and yet it was a fact that if syme grasped even for three seconds the nature of his winston s secret opinions he would betray him instantly to the thought police so would anybody else for that matter but syme more than most zeal was not enough orthodoxy was unconsciousness syme looked up here comes parsons he said something in the tone of his voice seemed to add that bloody fool parsons winston s fellow tenant at victory mansions was in fact threading his way across the room a tubby middle sized man with fair hair and a froglike face at thirty five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline but his movements were brisk and boyish his whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts grey shirt and red neckerchief of the spies in visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms parsons did indeed invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so he greeted them both with a cheery hullo hullo and sat down at the table giving off an intense smell of sweat beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face his powers of sweating were extraordinary at the community centre you could always tell when he had been playing table tennis by the dampness of the bat handle syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words and was studying it with an ink pencil between his fingers look at him working away in the lunch hour said parsons nudging winston keenness eh what s that you ve got there old boy something a bit too brainy for me i expect smith old boy i ll tell you why i m chasing you it s that sub you forgot to give me which sub is that said winston automatically feeling for money about a quarter of one s salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them for hate week you know the house by house fund i m treasurer for our block we re making an all out effort going to put on a tremendous show i tell you it won t be my fault if old victory mansions doesn t have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street two dollars you promised me winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes which parsons entered in a small notebook in the neat handwriting of the illiterate by the way old boy he said i hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday i gave him a good dressingdown for it in fact i told him i d take the catapult away if he does it again i think he was a little upset at not going to the execution said winston ah well what i mean to say shows the right spirit doesn t it mischievous little beggars they are both of them but talk about keenness all they think about is the spies and the war of course d you know what that little girl of mine did last saturday when her troop was on a hike out berkhamsted way she got two other girls to go with her slipped off from the hike and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man they kept on his tail for two hours right through the woods and then when they got into amersham handed him over to the patrols what did they do that for said winston somewhat taken aback parsons went on triumphantly my kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent might have been dropped by parachute for instance but here s the point old boy what do you think put her on to him in the first place she spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes said she d never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before so the chances were he was a foreigner pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh what happened to the man said winston ah that i couldn t say of course but i wouldn t be altogether surprised if parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle and clicked his tongue for the explosion good said syme abstractedly without looking up from his strip of paper of course we can t afford to take chances agreed winston dutifully what i mean to say there is a war on said parsons as though in confirmation of this a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads however it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time but merely an announcement from the ministry of plenty comrades cried an eager youthful voice attention comrades we have glorious news for you we have won the battle for production returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than per cent over the past year all over oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the new happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us here are some of the completed figures foodstuffs the phrase our new happy life recurred several times it had been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty parsons his attention caught by the trumpet call sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edified boredom he could not follow the figures but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction he had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco with the tobacco ration at grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal the new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left for the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week and only yesterday he reflected it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week was it possible that they could swallow that after only twenty four hours yes they swallowed it parsons swallowed it easily with the stupidity of an animal the eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes syme too in some more complex way involving doublethink syme swallowed it was he then alone in the possession of a memory the fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen as compared with last year there was more food more clothes more houses more furniture more cooking pots more fuel more ships more helicopters more books more babies more of everything except disease crime and insanity year by year and minute by minute everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards as syme had done earlier winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale coloured gravy that dribbled across the table drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern he meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life had it always been like this had food always tasted like this he looked round the canteen a low ceilinged crowded room its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies battered metal tables and chairs placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching bent spoons dented trays coarse white mugs all surfaces greasy grime in every crack and a sourish composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to it was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different in any time that he could accurately remember there had never been quite enough to eat one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes furniture had always been battered and rickety rooms underheated tube trains crowded houses falling to pieces bread dark coloured tea a rarity coffee filthy tasting cigarettes insufficient nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin and though of course it grew worse as one s body aged was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things if one s heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity the interminable winters the stickiness of one s socks the lifts that never worked the cold water the gritty soap the cigarettes that came to pieces the food with its strange evil tastes why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different he looked round the canteen again nearly everyone was ugly and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls on the far side of the room sitting at a table alone a small curiously beetle like man was drinking a cup of coffee his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side how easy it was thought winston if you did not look about you to believe that the physical type set up by the party as an ideal tall muscular youths and deep bosomed maidens blond haired vital sunburnt carefree existed and even predominated actually so far as he could judge the majority of people in airstrip one were small dark and ill favoured it was curious how that beetle like type proliferated in the ministries little dumpy men growing stout very early in life with short legs swift scuttling movements and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes it was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the party the announcement from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music parsons stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures took his pipe out of his mouth the ministry of plenty s certainly done a good job this year he said with a knowing shake of his head by the way smith old boy i suppose you haven t got any razor blades you can let me have not one said winston i ve been using the same blade for six weeks myself ah well just thought i d ask you old boy sorry said winston the quacking voice from the next table temporarily silenced during the ministry s announcement had started up again as loud as ever for some reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face within two years those children would be denouncing her to the thought police mrs parsons would be vaporized syme would be vaporized winston would be vaporized o brien would be vaporized parsons on the other hand would never be vaporized the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized the little beetle like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of ministries they too would never be vaporized and the girl with dark hair the girl from the fiction department she would never be vaporized either it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish though just what it was that made for survival it was not easy to say at this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk the girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him it was the girl with dark hair she was looking at him in a sidelong way but with curious intensity the instant she caught his eye she looked away again the sweat started out on winston s backbone a horrible pang of terror went through him it was gone almost at once but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind why was she watching him why did she keep following him about unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived or had come there afterwards but yesterday at any rate during the two minutes hate she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough his earlier thought returned to him probably she was not actually a member of the thought police but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all he did not know how long she had been looking at him but perhaps for as much as five minutes and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen the smallest thing could give you away a nervous tic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of muttering to yourself anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality of having something to hide in any case to wear an improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory was announced for example was itself a punishable offence there was even a word for it in newspeak facecrime it was called the girl had turned her back on him again perhaps after all she was not really following him about perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running his cigarette had gone out and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table he would finish smoking it after work if he could keep the tobacco in it quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the thought police and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of love within three days but a cigarette end must not be wasted syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket parsons had begun talking again did i ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round the stem of his pipe about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market woman s skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of b b sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches burned her quite badly i believe little beggars eh but keen as mustard that s a first rate training they give them in the spies nowadays better than in my day even what d you think s the latest thing they ve served them out with ear trumpets for listening through keyholes my little girl brought one home the other night tried it out on our sitting room door and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole of course it s only a toy mind you still gives em the right idea eh at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle it was the signal to return to work all three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out of winston s cigarette x x x winston was writing in his diary it was three years ago it was on a dark evening in a narrow side street near one of the big railway stations she was standing near a doorway in the wall under a street lamp that hardly gave any light she had a young face painted very thick it was really the paint that appealed to me the whiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lips party women never paint their faces there was nobody else in the
