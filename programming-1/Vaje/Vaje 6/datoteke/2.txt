street and no telescreens she said two dollars i for the moment it was too difficult to go on he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice or to bang his head against the wall to kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the window to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him your worst enemy he reflected was your own nervous system at any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back a quite ordinary looking man a party member aged thirty five to forty tallish and thin carrying a brief case they were a few metres apart when the left side of the man s face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm it happened again just as they were passing one another it was only a twitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter but obviously habitual he remembered thinking at the time that poor devil is done for and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep there was no way of guarding against that so far as he could see he drew his breath and went on writing i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen there was a bed against the wall and a lamp on the table turned down very low she his teeth were set on edge he would have liked to spit simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine his wife winston was married had been married at any rate probably he still was married so far as he knew his wife was not dead he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring because no woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so only the proles used scent in his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts consorting with prostitutes was forbidden of course but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break it was dangerous but it was not a life and death matter to be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced labour camp not more if you had committed no other offence and it was easy enough provided that you could avoid being caught in the act the poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin which the proles were not supposed to drink tacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed mere debauchery did not matter very much so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class the unforgivable crime was promiscuity between party members but though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control its real undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act not love so much as eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside it all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose and though the principle was never clearly stated permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema this again was never put into plain words but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member from childhood onwards there were even organizations such as the junior anti sex league which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes all children were to be begotten by artificial insemination artsem it was called in newspeak and brought up in public institutions this winston was aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party the party was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it could not be killed then to distort it and dirty it he did not know why this was so but it seemed natural that it should be so and as far as the women were concerned the party s efforts were largely successful he thought again of katharine it must be nine ten nearly eleven years since they had parted it was curious how seldom he thought of her for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married they had only been together for about fifteen months the party did not permit divorce but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children katharine was a tall fair haired girl very straight with splendid movements she had a bold aquiline face a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it very early in her married life he had decided though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people that she had without exception the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered she had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan and there was no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the party handed it out to her the human sound track he nicknamed her in his own mind yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing sex as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen to embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength the rigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression she would lie there with shut eyes neither resisting nor co operating but submitting it was extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate but curiously enough it was katharine who refused this they must she said produce a child if they could so the performance continued to happen once a week quite regulariy whenever it was not impossible she even used to remind him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten she had two names for it one was making a baby and the other was our duty to the party yes she had actually used that phrase quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round but luckily no child appeared and in the end she agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards they parted winston sighed inaudibly he picked up his pen again and wrote she threw herself down on the bed and at once without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you can imagine pulled up her skirt i he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharine s white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the party why did it always have to be like this why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event the women of the party were all alike chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty by careful early conditioning by games and cold water by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league by lectures parades songs slogans and martial music the natural feeling had been driven out of them his reason told him that there must be exceptions but his heart did not believe it they were all impregnable as the party intended that they should be and what he wanted more even than to be loved was to break down that wall of virtue even if it were only once in his whole life the sexual act successfully performed was rebellion desire was thoughtcrime even to have awakened katharine if he could have achieved it would have been like a seduction although she was his wife but the rest of the story had got to be written down he wrote i turned up the lamp when i saw her in the light after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright for the first time he could see the woman properly he had taken a step towards her and then halted full of lust and terror he was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment if he went away without even doing what he had come here to do it had got to be written down it had got to be confessed what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old the paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask there were streaks of white in her hair but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness she had no teeth at all he wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwriting when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fifty years old at least but i went ahead and did it just the same he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again he had written it down at last but it made no difference the therapy had not worked the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever x x x if there is hope wrote winston it lies in the proles if there was hope it must lie in the proles because only there in those swarming disregarded masses per cent of the population of oceania could the force to destroy the party ever be generated the party could not be overthrown from within its enemies if it had any enemies had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another even if the legendary brotherhood existed as just possibly it might it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes rebellion meant a look in the eyes an inflexion of the voice at the most an occasional whispered word but the proles if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength would have no need to conspire they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it and yet he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women s voices had burst from a side street a little way ahead it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud oh o o o oh that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell his heart had leapt it s started he had thought a riot the proles are breaking loose at last when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels it appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans they were wretched flimsy things but cooking pots of any kind were always difficult to get now the supply had unexpectedly given out the successful women bumped and jostled by the rest were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall accusing the stallkeeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve there was a fresh outburst of yells two bloated women one of them with her hair coming down had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another s hands for a moment they were both tugging and then the handle came off winston watched them disgustedly and yet just for a moment what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered he wrote until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious that he reflected might almost have been a transcription from one of the party textbooks the party claimed of course to have liberated the proles from bondage before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists they had been starved and flogged women had been forced to work in the coal mines women still did work in the coal mines as a matter of fact children had been sold into the factories at the age of six but simultaneously true to the principles of doublethink the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection like animals by the application of a few simple rules in reality very little was known about the proles it was not necessary to know much so long as they continued to work and breed their other activities were without importance left to themselves like cattle turned loose upon the plains of argentina they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern they were born they grew up in the gutters they went to work at twelve they passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual desire they married at twenty they were middle aged at thirty they died for the most part at sixty heavy physical work the care of home and children petty quarrels with neighbours films football beer and above all gambling filled up the horizon of their minds to keep them in control was not difficult a few agents of the thought police moved always among them spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party it was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations and even when they became discontented as they sometimes did their discontent led nowhere because being without general ideas they could only focus it on petty specific grievances the larger evils invariably escaped their notice the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes even the civil police interfered with them very little there was a vast amount of criminality in london a whole world within a world of thieves bandits prostitutes drug peddlers and racketeers of every description but since it all happened among the proles themselves it was of no importance in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code the sexual puritanism of the party was not imposed upon them promiscuity went unpunished divorce was permitted for that matter even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it they were beneath suspicion as the party slogan put it proles and animals are free winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer it had begun itching again the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like he took out of the drawer a copy of a children s history textbook which he had borrowed from mrs parsons and began copying a passage into the diary in the old days it ran before the glorious revolution london was not the beautiful city that we know today it was a dark dirty miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them these rich men were called capitalists they were fat ugly men with wicked faces like the one in the picture on the opposite page you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat and a queer shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe which was called a top hat this was the uniform of the capitalists and no one else was allowed to wear it the capitalists owned everything in the world and everyone else was their slave they owned all the land all the houses all the factories and all the money if anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison or they could take his job away and starve him to death when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him and take off his cap and address him as sir the chief of all the capitalists was called the king and but he knew the rest of the catalogue there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves the judges in their ermine robes the pillory the stocks the treadmill the cat o nine tails the lord mayor s banquet and the practice of kissing the pope s toe there was also something called the jus primae noctis which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories how could you tell how much of it was lies it might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity but simply its bareness its dinginess its listlessness life if you looked about you bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve great areas of it even for a party member were neutral and non political a matter of slogging through dreary jobs fighting for a place on the tube darning a worn out sock cadging a saccharine tablet saving a cigarette end the ideal set up by the party was something huge terrible and glittering a world of steel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually working fighting triumphing persecuting three hundred million people all with the same face the reality was decaying dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes in patched up nineteenth century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories he seemed to see a vision of london vast and ruinous city of a million dustbins and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs parsons a woman with lined face and wispy hair fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste pipe he reached down and scratched his ankle again day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food more clothes better houses better recreations that they lived longer worked shorter hours were bigger healthier stronger happier more intelligent better educated than the people of fifty years ago not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved the party claimed for example that today per cent of adult proles were literate before the revolution it was said the number had only been per cent the party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only per thousand whereas before the revolution it had been and so it went on it was like a single equation with two unknowns it might very well be that literally every word in the history books even the things that one accepted without question was pure fantasy for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis or any such creature as a capitalist or any such garment as a top hat everything faded into mist the past was erased the erasure was forgotten the lie became truth just once in his life he had possessed after the event that was what counted concrete unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds in it must have been at any rate it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted but the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier the story really began in the middle sixties the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all by none of them was left except big brother himself all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter revolutionaries goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where and of the others a few had simply disappeared while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes among the last survivors were three men named jones aaronson and rutherford it must have been in that these three had been arrested as often happened they had vanished for a year or more so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy at that date too the enemy was eurasia embezzlement of public funds the murder of various trusted party members intrigues against the leadership of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people after confessing to these things they had been pardoned reinstated in the party and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important all three had written long abject articles in the times analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree cafe he remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye they were men far older than himself relics of the ancient world almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the party the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them he had the feeling though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother but also they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them it was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe of the three it was rutherford whose appearance had most impressed winston rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution even now at long intervals his cartoons were appearing in the times they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner and curiously lifeless and unconvincing always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes slum tenements starving children street battles capitalists in top hats even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless hopeless effort to get back into the past he was a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hair his face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips at one time he must have been immensely strong now his great body was sagging sloping bulging falling away in every direction he seemed to be breaking up before one s eyes like a mountain crumbling it was the lonely hour of fifteen winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time the place was almost empty a tinny music was trickling from the telescreens the three men sat in their corner almost motionless never speaking uncommanded the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin there was a chessboard on the table beside them with the pieces set out but no game started and then for perhaps half a minute in all something happened to the telescreens the tune that they were playing changed and the tone of the music changed too there came into it but it was something hard to describe it was a peculiar cracked braying jeering note in his mind winston called it a yellow note and then a voice from the telescreen was singing under the spreading chestnut tree i sold you and you sold me there lie they and here lie we under the spreading chestnut tree the three men never stirred but when winston glanced again at rutherford s ruinous face he saw that his eyes were full of tears and for the first time he noticed with a kind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at what he shuddered that both aaronson and rutherford had broken noses a little later all three were re arrested it appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release at their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again with a whole string of new ones they were executed and their fate was recorded in the party histories a warning to posterity about five years after this in winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance it was a half page torn out of the times of about ten years earlier the top half of the page so that it included the date and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some party function in new york prominent in the middle of the group were jones aaronson and rutherford there was no mistaking them in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom the point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil they had flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia and had conferred with members of the eurasian general staff to whom they had betrayed important military secrets the date had stuck in winston s memory because it chanced to be midsummer day but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well there was only one possible conclusion the confessions were lies of course this was not in itself a discovery even at that time winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of but this was concrete evidence it was a fragment of the abolished past like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory it was enough to blow the party to atoms if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known he had gone straight on working as soon as he saw what the photograph was and what it meant he had covered it up with another sheet of paper luckily when he unrolled it it had been upside down from the point of view of the telescreen he took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible to keep your face expressionless was not difficult and even your breathing could be controlled with an effort but you could not control the beating of your heart and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up he let what he judged to be ten minutes go by tormented all the while by the fear that some accident a sudden draught blowing across his desk for instance would betray him then without uncovering it again he dropped the photograph into the memory hole along with some other waste papers within another minute perhaps it would have crumbled into ashes that was ten eleven years ago today probably he would have kept that photograph it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now when the photograph itself as well as the event it recorded was only memory was the party s hold upon the past less strong he wondered because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed but today supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes the photograph might not even be evidence already at the time when he made his discovery oceania was no longer at war with eurasia and it must have been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country since then there had been other changes two three he could not remember how many very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance the past not only changed but changed continuously what most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious but the ultimate motive was mysterious he took up his pen again and wrote i understand how i do not understand why he wondered as he had many times wondered before whether he himself was a lunatic perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one at one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun today to believe that the past is inalterable he might be alone in holding that belief and if alone then a lunatic but the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him the horror was that he might also be wrong he picked up the children s history book and looked at the portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiece the hypnotic eyes gazed into his own it was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you something that penetrated inside your skull battering against your brain frightening you out of your beliefs persuading you almost to deny the evidence of your senses in the end the party would announce that two and two made five and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy the heresy of heresies was common sense and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise but that they might be right for after all how do we know that two and two make four or that the force of gravity works or that the past is unchangeable if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is controllable what then but no his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord the face of o brien not called up by any obvious association had floated into his mind he knew with more certainty than before that o brien was on his side he was writing the diary for o brien to o brien it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it was their final most essential command his heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow him in debate the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand much less answer and yet he was in the right they were wrong and he was right the obvious the silly and the true had got to be defended truisms are true hold on to that the solid world exists its laws do not change stones are hard water is wet objects unsupported fall towards the earth s centre with the feeling that he was speaking to o brien and also that he was setting forth an important axiom he wrote freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four if that is granted all else follows x x x from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee real coffee not victory coffee came floating out into the street winston paused involuntarily for perhaps two seconds he was back in the half forgotten world of his childhood then a door banged seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound he had walked several kilometres over pavements and his varicose ulcer was throbbing this was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community centre a rash act since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the centre was carefully checked in principle a party member had no spare time and was never alone except in bed it was assumed that when he was not working eating or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude even to go for a walk by yourself was always slightly dangerous there was a word for it in newspeak ownlife it was called meaning individualism and eccentricity but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air had tempted him the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the centre the boring exhausting games the lectures the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin had seemed intolerable on impulse he had turned away from the bus stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of london first south then east then north again losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going if there is hope he had written in the diary it lies in the proles the words kept coming back to him statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity he was somewhere in the vague brown coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been saint pancras station he was walking up a cobbled street of little two storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes there were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles in and out of the dark doorways and down narrow alley ways that branched off on either side people swarmed in astonishing numbers girls in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouths and youths who chased the girls and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years time and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up most of the people paid no attention to winston a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity two monstrous women with brick red forearms folded across thelr aprons were talking outside a doorway winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached yes i says to er that s all very well i says but if you d of been in my place you d of done the same as what i done it s easy to criticize i says but you ain t got the same problems as what i got ah said the other that s jest it that s jest where it is the strident voices stopped abruptly the women studied him in hostile silence as he went past but it was not hostility exactly merely a kind of wariness a momentary stiffening as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal the blue overalls of the party could not be a common sight in a street like this indeed it was unwise to be seen in such places unless you had definite business there the patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them may i see your papers comrade what are you doing here what time did you leave work is this your usual way home and so on and so forth not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought police heard about it suddenly the whole street was in commotion there were yells of warning from all sides people were shooting into the doorways like rabbits a young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of winston grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle whipped her apron round it and leapt back again all in one movement at the same instant a man in a concertina like black suit who had emerged from a side alley ran towards winston pointing excitedly to the sky steamer he yelled look out guv nor bang over ead lay down quick steamer was a nickname which for some reason the proles applied to rocket bombs winston promptly flung himself on his face the proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind they seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound winston clasped his forearms above his head there was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave a shower of light objects pattered on to his back when he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window he walked on the bomb had demolished a group of houses metres up the street a black plume of smoke hung in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins there was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak when he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist apart from the bloody stump the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast he kicked the thing into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd turned down a side street to the right within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened it was nearly twenty hours and the drinking shops which the proles frequented pubs they called them were choked with customers from their grimy swing doors endlessly opening and shutting there came forth a smell of urine sawdust and sour beer in an angle formed by a projecting house front three men were standing very close together the middle one of them holding a folded up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies it was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading he was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation for a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows can t you bleeding well listen to what i say i tell you no number ending in seven ain t won for over fourteen months yes it as then no it as not back ome i got the ole lot of em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper i takes em down reg lar as the clock an i tell you no number ending in seven yes a seven as won i could pretty near tell you the bleeding number four oh seven it ended in it were in february second week in february february your grandmother i got it all down in black and white an i tell you no number oh pack it in said the third man they were talking about the lottery winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres they were still arguing with vivid passionate faces the lottery with its weekly pay out of enormous prizes was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention it was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive it was their delight their folly their anodyne their intellectual stimulant where the lottery was concerned even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory there was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems forecasts and lucky amulets winston had nothing to do with the running of the lottery which was managed by the ministry of plenty but he was aware indeed everyone in the party was aware that the prizes were largely imaginary only small sums were actually paid out the winners of the big prizes being non existent persons in the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of oceania and another this was not difficult to arrange but if there was hope it lay in the proles you had to cling on to that when you put it in words it sounded reasonable it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith the street into which he had turned ran downhill he had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away from somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices the street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tired looking vegetables at this moment winston remembered where he was the alley led out into the main street and down the next turning not five minutes away was the junk shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary and in a small stationer s shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink he paused for a moment at the top of the steps on the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust a very old man bent but active with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn pushed open the swing door and went in as winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old man who must be eighty at the least had already been middle aged when the revolution happened he and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism in the party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the revolution the older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender if there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century it could only be a prole suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into winston s mind and a lunatic impulse took hold of him he would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him he would say to him tell me about your life when you were a boy what was it like in those days were things better than they are now or were they worse hurriedly lest he should have time to become frightened he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street it was madness of course as usual there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness but it was not likely that they would believe him he pushed open the door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face as he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls a game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds the old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar having some kind of altercation with the barman a large stout hook nosed young man with enormous forearms a knot of others standing round with glasses in their hands were watching the scene i arst you civil enough didn t i said the old man straightening his shoulders pugnaciously you telling me you ain t got a pint mug in the ole bleeding boozer and what in hell s name is a pint said the barman leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter ark at im calls isself a barman and don t know what a pint is why a pint s the alf of a quart and there s four quarts to the gallon ave to teach you the a b c next never heard of em said the barman shortly litre and half litre that s all we serve there s the glasses on the shelf in front of you i likes a pint persisted the old man you could a drawed me off a pint easy enough we didn t ave these bleeding litres when i was a young man when you were a young man we were all living in the treetops said the barman with a glance at the other customers there was a shout of laughter and the uneasiness caused by winston s entry seemed to disappear the old man s whitestubbled face had flushed pink he turned away muttering to himself and bumped into winston winston caught him gently by the arm may i offer you a drink he said you re a gent said the other straightening his shoulders again he appeared not to have noticed winston s blue overalls pint he added aggressively to the barman pint of wallop the barman swished two half litres of dark brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs the proles were supposed not to drink gin though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough the game of darts was in full swing again and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets winston s presence was forgotten for a moment there was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard it was horribly dangerous but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in e could a drawed me off a pint grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass a alf litre ain t enough it don t satisfy and a ole litre s too much it starts my bladder running let alone the price you must have seen great changes since you were a young man said winston tentatively the old man s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar and from the bar to the door of the gents as though it were in the bar room that he expected the changes to have occurred the beer was better he said finally and cheaper when i was a young man mild beer wallop we used to call it was fourpence a pint that was before the war of course which war was that said winston it s all wars said the old man vaguely he took up his glass and his shoulders straightened again ere s wishing you the very best of ealth in his lean throat the sharp pointed adam s apple made a surprisingly rapid up and down movement and the beer vanished winston went to the bar and came back with two more half litres the old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full litre you are very much older than i am said winston you must have been a grown man before i was born you can remember what it was like in the old days before the revolution people of my age don t really know anything about those times we can only read about them in books and what it says in the books may not be true i should like your opinion on that the history books say that life before the revolution was completely different from what it is now there was the most terrible oppression injustice poverty worse than anything we can imagine here in london the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death half of them hadn t even boots on their feet they worked twelve hours a day they left school at nine they slept ten in a room and at the same time there were a very few people only a few thousands the capitalists they were called who were rich and powerful they owned everything that there was to own they lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants they rode about in motor cars and four horse carriages they drank champagne they wore top hats the old man brightened suddenly top ats he said funny you should mention em the same thing come into my ead only yesterday i dono why i was jest thinking i ain t seen a top at in years gorn right out they ave the last time i wore one was at my sister in law s funeral and that was well i couldn t give you the date but it must a been fifty years ago of course it was only ired for the occasion you understand it isn t very important about the top hats said winston patiently the point is these capitalists they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them were the lords of the earth everything existed for their benefit you the ordinary people the workers were their slaves they could do what they liked with you they could ship you off to canada like cattle they could sleep with your daughters if they chose they could order you to be flogged with something called a cat o nine tails you had to take your cap off when you passed them every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who the old man brightened again lackeys he said now there s a word i ain t eard since ever so long lackeys that reg lar takes me back that does i recollect oh donkey s years ago i used to sometimes go to yde park of a sunday afternoon to ear the blokes making speeches salvation army roman catholics jews indians all sorts there was and there was one bloke well i couldn t give you is name but a real powerful speaker e was e didn t alf give it em lackeys e says lackeys of the bourgeoisie flunkies of the ruling class parasites that was another of them and yenas e definitely called em yenas of course e was referring to the labour party you understand winston had the feeling that they were talking at crosspurposes what i really wanted to know was this he said do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days are you treated more like a human being in the old days the rich people the people at the top the ouse of lords put in the old man reminiscently the house of lords if you like what i am asking is were these people able to treat you as an inferior simply because they were rich and you were poor is it a fact for instance that you had to call them sir and take off your cap when you passed them the old man appeared to think deeply he drank off about a quarter of his beer before answering yes he said they liked you to touch your cap to em it showed respect like i didn t agree with it myself but i done it often enough had to as you might say and was it usual i m only quoting what i ve read in history books was it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter one of em pushed me once said the old man i recollect it as if it was yesterday it was boat race night terribly rowdy they used to get on boat race night and i bumps into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenue quite a gent e was dress shirt top at black overcoat e was kind of zig zagging across the pavement and i bumps into im accidental like e says why can t you look where you re going e says i say ju think you ve bought the bleeding pavement e says i ll twist your bloody ead off if you get fresh with me i says you re drunk i ll give you in charge in alf a minute i says an if you ll believe me e puts is and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus well i was young in them days and i was going to ave fetched im one only a sense of helplessness took hold of winston the old man s memory was nothing but a rubbish heap of details one could question him all day without getting any real information the party histories might still be true after a fashion they might even be completely true he made a last attempt perhaps i have not made myself clear he said what i m trying to say is this you have been alive a very long time you lived half your life before the revolution in for instance you were already grown up would you say from what you can remember that life in was better than it is now or worse if you could choose would you prefer to live then or now the old man looked meditatively at the darts board he finished up his beer more slowly than before when he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air as though the beer had mellowed him i know what you expect me to say he said you expect me to say as i d sooner be young again most people d say they d sooner be young if you arst em you got your ealth and strength when you re young when you get to my time of life you ain t never well i suffer something wicked from my feet and my bladder s jest terrible six and seven times a night it as me out of bed on the other and there s great advantages in being a old man you ain t got the same worries no truck with women and that s a great thing i ain t ad a woman
