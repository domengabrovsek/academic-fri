for near on thirty year if you d credit it nor wanted to what s more winston sat back against the window sill it was no use going on he was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room the extra half litre was already working on him winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again within twenty years at the most he reflected the huge and simple question was life better before the revolution than it is now would have ceased once and for all to be answerable but in effect it was unanswerable even now since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another they remembered a million useless things a quarrel with a workmate a hunt for a lost bicycle pump the expression on a long dead sister s face the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision they were like the ant which can see small objects but not large ones and when memory failed and written records were falsified when that happened the claim of the party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted because there did not exist and never again could exist any standard against which it could be tested at this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly he halted and looked up he was in a narrow street with a few dark little shops interspersed among dwelling houses immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded he seemed to know the place of course he was standing outside the junk shop where he had bought the diary a twinge of fear went through him it had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning and he had sworn never to come near the place again and yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander his feet had brought him back here of their own accord it was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary at the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty one hours the shop was still open with the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement he stepped through the doorway if questioned he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades the proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell he was a man of perhaps sixty frail and bowed with a long benevolent nose and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles his hair was almost white but his eyebrows were bushy and still black his spectacles his gentle fussy movements and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet gave him a vague air of intellectuality as though he had been some kind of literary man or perhaps a musician his voice was soft as though faded and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles i recognized you on the pavement he said immediately you re the gentleman that bought the young lady s keepsake album that was a beautiful bit of paper that was cream laid it used to be called there s been no paper like that made for oh i dare say fifty years he peered at winston over the top of his spectacles is there anything special i can do for you or did you just want to look round i was passing said winston vaguely i just looked in i don t want anything in particular it s just as well said the other because i don t suppose i could have satisfied you he made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand you see how it is an empty shop you might say between you and me the antique trade s just about finished no demand any longer and no stock either furniture china glass it s all been broken up by degrees and of course the metal stuff s mostly been melted down i haven t seen a brass candlestick in years the tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value the floorspace was very restricted because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture frames in the window there were trays of nuts and bolts worn out chisels penknives with broken blades tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order and other miscellaneous rubbish only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends lacquered snuffboxes agate brooches and the like which looked as though they might include something interesting as winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight and he picked it up it was a heavy lump of glass curved on one side flat on the other making almost a hemisphere there was a peculiar softness as of rainwater in both the colour and the texture of the glass at the heart of it magnified by the curved surface there was a strange pink convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone what is it said winston fascinated that s coral that is said the old man it must have come from the indian ocean they used to kind of embed it in the glass that wasn t made less than a hundred years ago more by the look of it it s a beautiful thing said winston it is a beautiful thing said the other appreciatively but there s not many that d say so nowadays he coughed now if it so happened that you wanted to buy it that d cost you four dollars i can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds and eight pounds was well i can t work it out but it was a lot of money but who cares about genuine antiques nowadays even the few that s left winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket what appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one the soft rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen the thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight it was very heavy in his pocket but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge it was a queer thing even a compromising thing for a party member to have in his possession anything old and for that matter anything beautiful was always vaguely suspect the old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two there s another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at he said there s not much in it just a few pieces we ll do with a light if we re going upstairs he lit another lamp and with bowed back led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney pots winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in there was a strip of carpet on the floor a picture or two on the walls and a deep slatternly arm chair drawn up to the fireplace an old fashioned glass clock with a twelve hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece under the window and occupying nearly a quarter of the room was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it we lived here till my wife died said the old man half apologetically i m selling the furniture off by little and little now that s a beautiful mahogany bed or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it but i dare say you d find it a little bit cumbersome he was holdlng the lamp high up so as to illuminate the whole room and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting the thought flitted through winston s mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week if he dared to take the risk it was a wild impossible notion to be abandoned as soon as thought of but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia a sort of ancestral memory it seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this in an arm chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob utterly alone utterly secure with nobody watching you no voice pursuing you no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock there s no telescreen he could not help murmuring ah said the old man i never had one of those things too expensive and i never seemed to feel the need of it somehow now that s a nice gateleg table in the corner there though of course you d have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps there was a small bookcase in the other corner and winston had already gravitated towards it it contained nothing but rubbish the hunting down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else it was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than the old man still carrying the lamp was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace opposite the bed now if you happen to be interested in old prints at all he began delicately winston came across to examine the picture it was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows and a small tower in front there was a railing running round the building and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue winston gazed at it for some moments it seemed vaguely familiar though he did not remember the statue the frame s fixed to the wall said the old man but i could unscrew it for you i dare say i know that building said winston finally it s a ruin now it s in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice that s right outside the law courts it was bombed in oh many years ago it was a church at one time st clement danes its name was he smiled apologetically as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous and added oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s what s that said winston oh oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s that was a rhyme we had when i was a little boy how it goes on i don t remember but i do know it ended up here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head it was a kind of a dance they held out their arms for you to pass under and when they came to here comes a chopper to chop off your head they brought their arms down and caught you it was just names of churches all the london churches were in it all the principal ones that is winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged it was always difficult to determine the age of a london building anything large and impressive if it was reasonably new in appearance was automatically claimed as having been built since the revolution while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the middle ages the centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value one could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books statues inscriptions memorial stones the names of streets anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered i never knew it had been a church he said there s a lot of them left really said the old man though they ve been put to other uses now how did that rhyme go ah i ve got it oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martin s there now that s as far as i can get a farthing thatwas a small copper coin looked something like a cent where was st martin s said winston st martin s that s still standing it s in victory square alongside the picture gallery a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front and a big flight of steps winston knew the place well it was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds scale models of rocket bombs and floating fortresses waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities and the like st martin s in the fields it used to be called supplemented the old man though i don t recollect any fields anywhere in those parts winston did not buy the picture it would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight and impossible to carry home unless it were taken out of its frame but he lingered for some minutes more talking to the old man whose name he discovered was not weeks as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop front but charrington mr charrington it seemed was a widower aged sixty three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window but had never quite got to the point of doing it all the while that they were talking the half remembered rhyme kept running through winston s head oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martin s it was curious but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells the bells of a lost london that still existed somewhere or other disguised and forgotten from one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing he got away from mr charrington and went down the stairs alone so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door he had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval a month say he would take the risk of visiting the shop again it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the centre the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted however yes he thought again he would come back he would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish he would buy the engraving of st clement danes take it out of its frame and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr charrington s memory even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again for perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window he had even started humming to an improvised tune oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s you owe me three farthings say the suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water a figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement not ten metres away it was the girl from the fiction department the girl with dark hair the light was failing but there was no difficulty in recognizing her she looked him straight in the face then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him for a few seconds winston was too paralysed to move then he turned to the right and walked heavily away not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction at any rate one question was settled there was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him she must have followed him here because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet kilometres distant from any quarter where party members lived it was too great a coincidence whether she was really an agent of the thought police or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness hardly mattered it was enough that she was watching him probably she had seen him go into the pub as well it was an effort to walk the lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away the worst thing was the pain in his belly for a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon but there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this then the spasm passed leaving a dull ache behind the street was a blind alley winston halted stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do then turned round and began to retrace his steps as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her he could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job but he abandoned the idea immediately because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable he could not run he could not strike a blow besides she was young and lusty and would defend herself he thought also of hurrying to the community centre and staying there till the place closed so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening but that too was impossible a deadly lassitude had taken hold of him all he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet it was after twenty two hours when he got back to the flat the lights would be switched off at the main at twenty three thirty he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of victory gin then he went to the table in the alcove sat down and took the diary out of the drawer but he did not open it at once from the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song he sat staring at the marbled cover of the book trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness it was at night that they came for you always at night the proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you undoubtedly some people did so many of the disappearances were actually suicides but it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms or any quick and certain poison were completely unprocurable he thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed he might have silenced the dark haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act it struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always against one s own body even now in spite of the gin the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible and it is the same he perceived in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations on the battlefield in the torture chamber on a sinking ship the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten because the body swells up until it fills the universe and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain life is a moment to moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness against a sour stomach or an aching tooth he opened the diary it was important to write something down the woman on the telescreen had started a new song her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass he tried to think of o brien for whom or to whom the diary was written but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him away it would not matter if they killed you at once to be killed was what you expected but before death nobody spoke of such things yet everybody knew of them there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy the crack of broken bones the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair why did you have to endure it since the end was always the same why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life nobody ever escaped detection and nobody ever failed to confess when once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead why then did that horror which altered nothing have to lie embedded in future time he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of o brien we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness o brien had said to him he knew what it meant or thought he knew the place where there is no darkness was the imagined future which one would never see but which by foreknowledge one could mystically share in but with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further he put a cigarette in his mouth half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again the face of big brother swam into his mind displacing that of o brien just as he had done a few days earlier he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it the face gazed up at him heavy calm protecting but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache like a leaden knell the words came back at him war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength chapter two it was the middle of the morning and winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory a solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long brightly lit corridor it was the girl with dark hair four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk shop as she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were roughed in it was a common accident in the fiction department they were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face a sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her she must have fallen right on the injured arm winston stopped short the girl had risen to her knees her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever her eyes were fixed on his with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain a curious emotion stirred in winston s heart in front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him in front of him also was a human creature in pain and perhaps with a broken bone already he had instinctively started forward to help her in the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body you re hurt he said it s nothing my arm it ll be all right in a second she spoke as though her heart were fluttering she had certainly turned very pale you haven t broken anything no i m all right it hurt for a moment that s all she held out her free hand to him and he helped her up she had regained some of her colour and appeared very much better it s nothing she repeated shortly i only gave my wrist a bit of a bang thanks comrade and with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going as briskly as though it had really been nothing the whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute not to let one s feelings appear in one s face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand there was no question that she had done it intentionally it was something small and flat as he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers it was a scrap of paper folded into a square while he stood at the urinal he managed with a little more fingering to get it unfolded obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it for a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water closets and read it at once but that would be shocking folly as he well knew there was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously he went back to his cubicle sat down threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him five minutes he told himself five minutes at the very least his heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine the rectification of a long list of figures not needing close attention whatever was written on the paper it must have some kind of political meaning so far as he could see there were two possibilities one much the more likely was that the girl was an agent of the thought police just as he had feared he did not know why the thought police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion but perhaps they had their reasons the thing that was written on the paper might be a threat a summons an order to commit suicide a trap of some description but there was another wilder possibility that kept raising its head though he tried vainly to suppress it this was that the message did not come from the thought police at all but from some kind of underground organization perhaps the brotherhood existed after all perhaps the girl was part of it no doubt the idea was absurd but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand it was not till a couple of minutes later that the other more probable explanation had occurred to him and even now though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death still that was not what he believed and the unreasonable hope persisted and his heart banged and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite he rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube eight minutes had gone by he re adjusted his spectacles on his nose sighed and drew the next batch of work towards him with the scrap of paper on top of it he flattened it out on it was written in a large unformed handwriting i love you for several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole when he did so although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest he could not resist reading it once again just to make sure that the words were really there for the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work what was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen he felt as though a fire were burning in his belly lunch in the hot crowded noise filled canteen was torment he had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour but as bad luck would have it the imbecile parsons flopped down beside him the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate week he was particularly enthusiastic about a papier ma che model of big brother s head two metres wide which was being made for the occasion by his daughter s troop of spies the irritating thing was that in the racket of voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated just once he caught a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room she appeared not to have seen him and he did not look in that direction again the afternoon was more bearable immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside it consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the inner party who was now under a cloud this was the kind of thing that winston was good at and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether then the memory of her face came back and with it a raging intolerable desire to be alone until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out tonight was one of his nights at the community centre he wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen hurried off to the centre took part in the solemn foolery of a discussion group played two games of table tennis swallowed several glasses of gin and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled ingsoc in relation to chess his soul writhed with boredom but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the centre at the sight of the words i love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid it was not till twenty three hours when he was home and in bed in the darkness where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent that he was able to think continuously it was a physical problem that had to be solved how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting he did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him he knew that it was not so because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note obviously she had been frightened out of her wits as well she might be nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone but that was of no importance he thought of her naked youthful body as he had seen it in his dream he had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them her head stuffed with lies and hatred her belly full of ice a kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her the white youthful body might slip away from him what he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly but the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous it was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated whichever way you turned the telescreen faced you actually all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note but now with time to think he went over them one by one as though laying out a row of instruments on a table obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated if she had worked in the records department it might have been comparatively simple but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction departrnent lay and he had no pretext for going there if he had known where she lived and at what time she left work he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home but to try to follow her home was not safe because it would mean loitering about outside the ministry which was bound to be noticed as for sending a letter through the mails it was out of the question by a routine that was not even secret all letters were opened in transit actually few people ever wrote letters for the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable in any case he did not know the girl s name let alone her address finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen if he could get her at a table by herself somewhere in the middle of the room not too near the telescreens and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round if these conditions endured for say thirty seconds it might be possible to exchange a few words for a week after this life was like a restless dream on the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it the whistle having already blown presumably she had been changed on to a later shift they passed each other without a glance on the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all his whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity a sort of transparency which made every movement every sound every contact every word that he had to speak or listen to an agony even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image he did not touch the diary during those days if there was any relief it was in his work in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch he had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her there was no enquiry he could make she might have been vaporized she might have committed suicide she might have been transferred to the other end of oceania worst and likeliest of all she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him the next day she reappeared her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking plaster round her wrist the relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds on the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her when he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall and was quite alone it was early and the place was not very full the queue edged forward till winston was almost at the counter then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine but the girl was still alone when winston secured his tray and began to make for her table he walked casually towards her his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her she was perhaps three metres away from him another two seconds would do it then a voice behind him called smith he pretended not to hear smith repeated the voice more loudly it was no use he turned round a blond headed silly faced young man named wilsher whom he barely knew was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table it was not safe to refuse after having been recognized he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl it was too noticeable he sat down with a friendly smile the silly blond face beamed into his winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick axe right into the middle of it the girl s table filled up a few minutes later but she must have seen him coming towards her and perhaps she would take the hint next day he took care to arrive early surely enough she was at a table in about the same place and again alone the person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small swiftly moving beetle like man with a flat face and tiny suspicious eyes as winston turned away from the counter with his tray he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl s table his hopes sank again there was a vacant place at a table further away but something in the little man s appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table with ice at his heart winston followed it was no use unless he could get the girl alone at this moment there was a tremendous crash the little man was sprawling on all fours his tray had gone flying two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor he started to his feet with a malignant glance at winston whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up but it was all right five seconds later with a thundering heart winston was sitting at the girl s table he did not look at her he unpacked his tray and promptly began eating it was all important to speak at once before anyone else came but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him a week had gone by since she had first approached him she would have changed her mind she must have changed her mind it was impossible that this affair should end successfully such things did not happen in real life he might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen ampleforth the hairy eared poet wandering limply round the room with a tray looking for a place to sit down in his vague way ampleforth was attached to winston and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him there was perhaps a minute in which to act both winston and the girl were eating steadily the stuff they were eating was a thin stew actually a soup of haricot beans in a low murmur winston began speaking neither of them looked up steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices what time do you leave work eighteen thirty where can we meet victory square near the monument it s full of telescreens it doesn t matter if there s a crowd any signal no don t come up to me until you see me among a lot of people and don t look at me just keep somewhere near me what time nineteen hours all right ampleforth failed to see winston and sat down at another table they did not speak again and so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table they did not look at one another the girl finished her lunch quickly and made off while winston stayed to smoke a cigarette winston was in victory square before the appointed time he wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column at the top of which big brother s statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the eurasian aeroplanes the eastasian aeroplanes it had been a few years ago in the battle of airstrip one in the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent oliver cromwell at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared again the terrible fear seized upon winston she was not coming she had changed her mind he walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale coloured pleasure from identifying st martin s church whose bells when it had bells had chimed you owe me three farthings then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column it was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated there were telescreens all round the pediment but at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square the girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush winston followed as he ran he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of eurasian prisoners was passing already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square winston at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage shoved butted squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd soon he was within arm s length of the girl but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman presumably his wife who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh winston wriggled himself sideways and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them for a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips then he had broken through sweating a little he was next to the girl they were shoulder to shoulder both staring fixedly in front of them a long line of trucks with wooden faced guards armed with sub machine guns standing upright in each corner was passing slowly down the street in the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting jammed close together their sad mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly incurious occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clankclank of metal all the prisoners were wearing leg irons truckload after truck load of the sad faces passed winston knew they were there but he saw them only intermittently the girl s shoulder and her arm right down to the elbow were pressed against his her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth she had immediately taken charge of the situation just as she had done in the canteen she began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before with lips barely moving a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks can you hear me yes can you get sunday afternoon off yes then listen carefully you ll have to remember this go to paddington station with a sort of military precision that astonished him she outlined the route that he was to follow a half hour railway journey turn left outside the station two kilometres along the road a gate with the top bar missing a path across a field a grass grown lane a track between bushes a dead tree with moss on it it was as though she had a map inside her head can you remember all that she murmured finally yes you turn left then right then left again and the gate s got no top bar yes what time about fifteen you may have to wait i ll get there by another way are you sure you remember everything yes then get away from me as quick as you can she need not have told him that but for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd the trucks were still filing post the people still insatiably gaping at the start there had been a few boos and hisses but it came only from the party members among the crowd and had soon stopped the prevailing emotion was simply curiosity foreigners whether from eurasia or from eastasia were a kind of strange animal one literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them nor did one know what became of them apart from the few who were hanged as war criminals te others simply vanished presumably into forced labour camps the round mogol faces had given way to faces of a more european type dirty bearded and exhausted from over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into winston s sometimes with strange intensity and flashed away again the convoy was drawing to an end in the last truck he could see an aged man his face a mass of grizzled hair standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him as though he were used to having them bound together it was almost time for winston and the girl to part but at the last moment while the crowd still hemmed them in her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze it could not have been ten seconds and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together he had time to learn every detail of her hand he explored the long fingers the shapely nails the work hardened palm with its row of callouses the smooth flesh under the wrist merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight in the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl s eyes were they were probably brown but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes to turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly with hands locked together invisible among the press of bodies they stared steadily in front of them and instead of the eyes of the girl the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at winston out of nests of hair x x x winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells the air seemed to kiss one s skin it was the second of may from somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves he was a bit early there had been no difficulties about the journey and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place in general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in london there were no telescreens of course but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized besides it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention for distances of less than kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations who examined the papers of any party member they found there and asked awkward questions however no patrols had appeared and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed the train was full of proles in holiday mood because of the summery weather the wooden seated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family ranging from a toothless great grandmother to a month old baby going out to spend an afternoon with in laws in the country and as they freely explained to winston to get hold of a little blackmarket butter the lane widened and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of a mere cattle track which plunged between the bushes he had no watch but it could not be fifteen yet the bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them he knelt down and began picking some partly to pass the time away but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met he had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs he went on picking bluebells it was the best thing to do it might be the girl or he might have been followed after all to look round was to show guilt he picked another and another a hand fell lightly on his shoulder he looked up it was the girl she shook her head evidently as a warning that he must keep silent then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood obviously she had been that way before for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit winston followed still clasping his bunch of flowers his first feeling was relief but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him already on the walk from the station the may sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated a creature of indoors with the sooty dust of london in the pores of his skin it occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open they came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of the girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes in which there did not seem to be an opening when winston followed her he found that they were in a natural clearing a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely the girl stopped and turned here we are she said he was facing her at several paces distance as yet he did not dare move nearer to her i didn t want to say anything in the lane she went on in case there s a mike hidden there i don t suppose there is but there could be there s always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice we re all right here he still had not the courage to approach her we re all right here he repeated stupidly yes look at the trees they were small ashes which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles none of them thicker than one s wrist there s nothing big enough to hide a mike in besides i ve been here before they were only making conversation he had managed to move closer to her now she stood before him very upright with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act the bluebells had cascaded on to the ground they seemed to have fallen of their own accord he took her hand would you believe he said that till this moment i didn t know what colour your eyes were they were brown he noted a rather light shade of brown with dark lashes now that you ve seen what i m really like can you still bear to look at me yes easily i m thirty nine years old i ve got a wife that i can t get rid of i ve got varicose veins i ve got five false teeth i couldn t care less said the girl the next moment it was hard to say by whose act she was in his his arms at the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity the youthful body was strained against his own the mass of dark hair was against his face and yes actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth she had clasped her arms about his neck she was calling him darling precious one loved one he had pulled her down on to the ground she was utterly unresisting he could do what he liked with her but the truth was that he had no physical sensation except that of mere contact all he felt was incredulity and pride he was glad that this was happening but he had no physical desire it was too soon her youth and prettiness had frightened him he was too much used to living without women he did not know the reason the girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair she sat against him putting her arm round his waist never mind dear there s no hurry we ve got the whole afternoon isn t this a splendid hide out i found it when i got lost once on a community hike if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away what is your name said winston julia i know yours it s winston winston smith how did you find that out i expect i m better at finding things out than you are dear tell me what did you think of me before that day i gave you the note he did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her it was even a sort of love offering to start off by telling the worst i hated the sight of you he said i wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards two weeks ago i thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone if you really want to know i imagined that you had something to do with the thought police the girl laughed delightedly evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise not the thought police you didn t honestly think that well perhaps not exactly that but from your general appearance merely because you re young and fresh and healthy you understand i thought that probably you thought i was a good party member pure in word and deed banners processions slogans games community hikes all that stuff and you thought that if i had a quarter of a chance i d denounce you as a thought criminal and get you killed off yes something of that kind a great many young girls are like that you know it s this bloody thing that does it she said ripping off the scarlet sash of the junior anti sex league and flinging it on to a bough then as though touching her waist had reminded her of something she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate she broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to winston even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate it was dark and shiny and was wrapped in silver paper chocolate normally was dullbrown crumbly stuff that tasted as nearly as one could describe it like the smoke of a rubbish fire but at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him the first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down but which was powerful and troubling where did you get this stuff he said black market she said indifferently actually i am that sort of girl to look at i m good at games i was a troop leader in the spies i do voluntary work three evenings a week for the junior anti sex league hours and hours i ve spent pasting their bloody rot all over london i always carry one end of a banner in the processions i always iook cheerful and i never shirk anything always yell with the crowd that s what i say it s the only way to be safe the first fragment of chocolate had meited on winston s tongue the taste was delightful but there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape like an object seen out of the corner of one s eye he pushed it away from him aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not you are very young he said you are ten or fifteen years younger than i am what could you see to
