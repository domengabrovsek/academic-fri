attract you in a man like me it was something in your face i thought i d take a chance i m good at spotting people who don t belong as soon as i saw you i knew you were against them them it appeared meant the party and above all the inner party about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made winston feel uneasy although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere a thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language party members were supposed not to swear and winston himself very seldom did swear aloud at any rate julia however seemed unable to mention the party and especially the inner party without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alley ways he did not dislike it it was merely one symptom of her revolt against the party and all its ways and somehow it seemed natural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay they had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade with their arms round each other s waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast he noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone they did not speak above a whisper outside the clearing julia said it was better to go quietly presently they had reached the edge of the little wood she stopped him don t go out into the open there might be someone watching we re all right if we keep behind the boughs they were standing in the shade of hazel bushes the sunlight filtering through innumerable leaves was still hot on their faces winston looked out into the field beyond and underwent a curious slow shock of recognition he knew it by sight an old closebitten pasture with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there in the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women s hair surely somewhere nearby but out of sight there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming isn t there a stream somewhere near here he whispered that s right there is a stream it s at the edge of the next field actually there are fish in it great big ones you can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees waving their tails it s the golden country almost he murmured the golden country it s nothing really a landscape i ve seen sometimes in a dream look whispered julia a thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away almost at the level of their faces perhaps it had not seen them it was in the sun they in the shade it spread out its wings fitted them carefully into place again ducked its head for a moment as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun and then began to pour forth a torrent of song in the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling winston and julia clung together fascinated the music went on and on minute after minute with astonishing variations never once repeating itself almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity sometimes it stopped for a few seconds spread out and resettled its wings then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence for whom for what was that bird singing no mate no rival was watching it what made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness he wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near he and julia had spoken only in low whispers and it would not pick up what they had said but it would pick up the thrush perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small beetle like man was listening intently listening to that but by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind it was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves he stopped thinking and merely felt the girl s waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm he pulled her round so that they were breast to breast her body seemed to melt into his wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as water their mouths clung together it was quite different from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier when they moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply the bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings winston put his lips against her ear now he whispered not here she whispered back come back to the hide out it s safer quickly with an occasional crackle of twigs they threaded their way back to the clearing when they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him they were both breathing fast but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth she stood looking at him for an instant then felt at the zipper of her overalls and yes it was almost as in his dream almost as swiftly as he had imagined it she had torn her clothes off and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated her body gleamed white in the sun but for a moment he did not look at her body his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint bold smile he knelt down before her and took her hands in his have you done this before of course hundreds of times well scores of times anyway with party members yes always with party members with members of the inner party not with those swine no but there s plenty that would if they got half a chance they re not so holy as they make out his heart leapt scores of times she had done it he wished it had been hundreds thousands anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope who knew perhaps the party was rotten under the surface its cult of strenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham concealing iniquity if he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis how gladly he would have done so anything to rot to weaken to undermine he pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face listen the more men you ve had the more i love you do you understand that yes perfectly i hate purity i hate goodness i don t want any virtue to exist anywhere i want everyone to be corrupt to the bones well then i ought to suit you dear i m corrupt to the bones you like doing this i don t mean simply me i mean the thing in itself i adore it that was above all what he wanted to hear not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct the simple undifferentiated desire that was the force that would tear the party to pieces he pressed her down upon the grass among the fallen bluebells this time there was no difficulty presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart the sun seemed to have grown hotter they were both sleepy he reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour winston woke first he sat up and watched the freckled face still peacefully asleep pillowed on the palm of her hand except for her mouth you could not call her beautiful there was a line or two round the eyes if you looked closely the short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft it occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived the young strong body now helpless in sleep awoke in him a pitying protecting feeling but the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree while the thrush was singing had not quite come back he pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank in the old days he thought a man looked at a girl s body and saw that it was desirable and that was the end of the story but you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays no emotion was pure because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred their embrace had been a battle the climax a victory it was a blow struck against the party it was a political act x x x we can come here once again said julia it s generally safe to use any hide out twice but not for another month or two of course as soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed she became alert and business like put her clothes on knotted the scarlet sash about her waist and began arranging the details of the journey home it seemed natural to leave this to her she obviously had a practical cunning which winston lacked and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round london stored away from innumerable community hikes the route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come and brought him out at a different railway station never go home the same way as you went out she said as though enunciating an important general principle she would leave first and winston was to wait half an hour before following her she had named a place where they could meet after work four evenings hence it was a street in one of the poorer quarters where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy she would be hanging about among the stalls pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing thread if she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition but with luck in the middle of the crowd it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting and now i must go she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions i m due back at nineteen thirty i ve got to put in two hours for the junior anti sex league handing out leaflets or something isn t it bloody give me a brush down would you have i got any twigs in my hair are you sure then good bye my love good bye she flung herself into his arms kissed him almost violently and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise even now he had not found out her surname or her address however it made no difference for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication as it happened they never went back to the clearing in the wood during the month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love that was in another hidlng place known to julia the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier it was a good hiding place when once you got there but the getting there was very dangerous for the rest they could meet only in the streets in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time in the street it was usually possible to talk after a fashion as they drifted down the crowded pavements not quite abreast and never looking at one another they carried on a curious intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot then continued almost without introduction on the following day julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation which she called talking by instalments she was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss they were passing in silence down a side street julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets when there was a deafening roar the earth heaved and the air darkened and winston found himself lying on his side bruised and terrified a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand suddenly he became aware of julia s face a few centimetres from his own deathly white as white as chalk even her lips were white she was dead he clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster there were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead even if it had been less dangerous it would still have been difficult to find time to meet winston s working week was sixty hours julia s was even longer and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide julia in any case seldom had an evening completely free she spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations distributing literature for the junior anti sex league preparing banners for hate week making collections for the savings campaign and such like activities it paid she said it was camouflage if you kept the small rules you could break the big ones she even induced winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous party members so one evening every week winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses in a draughty ill lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens when they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up it was a blazing afternoon the air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung they sat talking for hours on the dusty twig littered floor one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming julia was twenty six years old she lived in a hostel with thirty other girls always in the stink of women how i hate women she said parenthetically and she worked as he had guessed on the novel writing machines in the fiction department she enjoyed her work which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor she was not clever but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery she could describe the whole process of composing a novel from the general directive issued by the planning committee down to the final touching up by the rewrite squad but she was not interested in the finished product she didn t much care for reading she said books were just a commodity that had to be produced like jam or bootlaces she had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight at school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running she had been a troop leader in the spies and a branch secretary in the youth league before joining the junior anti sex league she had always borne an excellent character she had even an infallibie mark of good reputation been picked out to work in pornosec the sub section of the fiction department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles it was nicknamed muck house by the people who worked in it she remarked there she had remained for a year helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like spanking stories or one night in a girls school to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal what are these books like said winston curiously oh ghastly rubbish they re boring really they only have six plots but they swap them round a bit of course i was only on the kaleidoscopes i was never in the rewrite squad i m not literary dear not even enough for that he learned with astonishment that all the workers in pornosec except the heads of the departments were girls the theory was that men whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled they don t even like having married women there she added girls are always supposed to be so pure here s one who isn t anyway she had had her first love affair when she was sixteen with a party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest and a good job too said julia otherwise they d have had my name out of him when he confessed since then there had been various others life as she saw it was quite simple you wanted a good time they meaning the party wanted to stop you having it you broke the rules as best you couid she seemed to think it just as natural that they should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught she hated the party and said so in the crudest words but she made no general criticism of it except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in party doctrine he noticed that she never used newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use she had never heard of the brotherhood and refused to believe in its existence any kind of organized revolt against the party which was bound to be a failure struck her as stupid the clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same he wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the revolution knowing nothing else accepting the party as something unalterable like the sky not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it as a rabbit dodges a dog they did not discuss the possibility of getting married it was too remote to be worth thinking about no imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine winston s wife could somehow have been got rid of it was hopeless even as a daydream what was she like your wife said julia she was do you know the newspeak word goodthinkful meaning naturally orthodox incapable of thinking a bad thought no i didn t know the word but i know the kind of person right enough he began telling her the story of his married life but curiousiy enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already she described to him almost as though she had seen or felt it the stiffening of katharine s body as soon as he touched her the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength even when her arms were clasped tightly round him with julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things katharine in any case had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one i could have stood it if it hadn t been for one thing he said he toid her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week she hated it but nothing would make her stop doing it she used to call it but you ll never guess our duty to the party said julia promptly how did you know that i ve been at school too dear sex talks once a month for the over sixteens and in the youth movement they rub it into you for years i dare say it works in a lot of cases but of course you can never tell peopie are such hypocrites she began to enlarge upon the subject with julia everything came back to her own sexuality as soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness unlike winston she had grasped the inner meaning of the party s sexual puritanism it was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the party s control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible what was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria which was desirable because it could be transformed into war fever and leader worship the way she put it was when you make love you re using up energy and afterwards you feel happy and don t give a damn for anything they can t bear you to feel like that they want you to be bursting with energy all the time all this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simpiy sex gone sour if you re happy inside yourself why should you get excited about big brother and the three year plans and the two minutes hate and all the rest of their bloody rot that was very true he thought there was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy for how could the fear the hatred and the lunatic credulity which the party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force the sex impulse was dangerous to the party and the party had turned it to account they had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood the family could not actually be abolished and indeed people were encouraged to be fond of their children in almost the old fashioned way the children on the other hand were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations the family had become in effect an extension of the thought police it was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately abruptly his mind went back to katharine katharine would unquestionably have denounced him to the thought police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions but what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon which had brought the sweat out on his forehead he began telling julia of something that had happened or rather had failed to happen on another sweltering summer afternoon eleven years ago it was three or four months after they were married they had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in kent they had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes but they took a wrong turning and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry it was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres with boulders at the bottom there was nobody of whom they could ask the way as soon as she realized that they were lost katharine became very uneasy to be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrong doing she wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction but at this moment winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them one tuft was of two colours magenta and brick red apparently growing on the same root he had never seen anything of the kind before and he called to katharine to come and look at it look katharine look at those flowers that clump down near the bottom do you see they re two different colours she had already turned to go but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment she even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing he was standing a little behind her and he put his hand on her waist to steady her at this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were there was not a human creature anywhere not a leaf stirring not even a bird awake in a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds it was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon the sun blazed down upon them the sweat tickled his face and the thought struck him why didn t you give her a good shove said julia i would have yes dear you would have i would if i d been the same person then as i am now or perhaps i would i m not certain are you sorry you didn t yes on the whole i m sorry i didn t they were sitting side by side on the dusty floor he pulled her closer against him her head rested on his shoulder the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung she was very young he thought she still expected something from life she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing actually it would have made no difference he said then why are you sorry you didn t do it only because i prefer a positive to a negative in this game that we re playing we can t win some kinds of failure are better than other kinds that s all he felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent she always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind she would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated in a way she realized that she herself was doomed that sooner or later the thought police would catch her and kill her but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose all you needed was luck and cunning and boldness she did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness that the only victory lay in the far future long after you were dead that from the moment of declaring war on the party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse we are the dead he said we re not dead yet said julia prosaically not physically six months a year five years conceivably i am afraid of death you are young so presumably you re more afraid of it than i am obviously we shall put it off as long as we can but it makes very little difference so long as human beings stay human death and life are the same thing oh rubbish which would you sooner sleep with me or a skeleton don t you enjoy being alive don t you like feeling this is me this is my hand this is my leg i m real i m solid i m alive don t you like this she twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him he could feel her breasts ripe yet firm through her overalls her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth and vigour into his yes i like that he said then stop talking about dying and now listen dear we ve got to fix up about the next time we meet we may as well go back to the place in the wood we ve given it a good long rest but you must get there by a different way this time i ve got it all planned out you take the train but look i ll draw it out for you and in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust and with a twig from a pigeon s nest began drawing a map on the floor x x x winston looked round the shabby little room above mr charrington s shop beside the window the enormous bed was made up with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster the old fashioned clock with the twelve hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece in the corner on the gateleg table the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half darkness in the fender was a battered tin oilstove a saucepan and two cups provided by mr charrington winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil he had brought an envelope full of victory coffee and some saccharine tablets the clock s hands said seventeen twenty it was nineteen twenty really she was coming at nineteen thirty folly folly his heart kept saying conscious gratuitous suicidal folly of all the crimes that a party member could commit this one was the least possible to conceal actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table as he had foreseen mr charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room he was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love affair instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible privacy he said was a very valuable thing everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally and when they had such a place it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself he even seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so added that there were two entries to the house one of them through the back yard which gave on an alley under the window somebody was singing winston peeped out secure in the protection of the muslin curtain the june sun was still high in the sky and in the sun filled court below a monstrous woman solid as a norman pillar with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line pegging out a series of square white things which winston recognized as babies diapers whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto it was only an opeless fancy it passed like an ipril dye but a look an a word an the dreams they stirred they ave stolen my eart awye the tune had been haunting london for weeks past it was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub section of the music department the words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator but the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound he could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones and the cries of the children in the street and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic and yet the room seemed curiously silent thanks to the absence of a telescreen folly folly folly he thought again it was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught but the temptation of having a hiding place that was truly their own indoors and near at hand had been too much for both of them for some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of hate week it was more than a month distant but the enormous complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day they had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood on the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street as usual winston hardly looked at julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual it s all off she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak tomorrow i mean what tomorrow afternoon i can t come why not oh the usual reason it s started early this time for a moment he was violently angry during the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed at the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it their first love making had been simply an act of the will but after the second time it was different the smell of her hair the taste of her mouth the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him or into the air all round him she had become a physical necessity something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to when she said that she could not come he had the feeling that she was cheating him but just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met she gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection it struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal recurring event and a deep tenderness such as he had not felt for her before suddenly took hold of him he wished that they were a married couple of ten years standing he wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household he wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met it was not actually at that moment but at some time on the following day that the idea of renting mr charrington s room had occurred to him when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness both of them knew that it was lunacy it was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves as he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of love it was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one s consciousness there it lay fixed in future times preceding death as surely as precedes one could not avoid it but one could perhaps postpone it and yet instead every now and again by a conscious wilful act one chose to shorten the interval before it happened at this moment there was a quick step on the stairs julia burst into the room she was carrying a tool bag of coarse brown canvas such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the ministry he started forward to take her in his arms but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly partly because she was still holding the tool bag half a second she said just let me show you what i ve brought did you bring some of that filthy victory coffee i thought you would you can chuck it away again because we shan t be needing it look here she fell on her knees threw open the bag and tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it underneath were a number of neat paper packets the first packet that she passed to winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling it was filled with some kind of heavy sand like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it it isn t sugar he said real sugar not saccharine sugar and here s a loaf of bread proper white bread not our bloody stuff and a little pot of jam and here s a tin of milk but look this is the one i m really proud of i had to wrap a bit of sacking round it because but she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up the smell was already filling the room a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood but which one did occasionally meet with even now blowing down a passage way before a door slammed or diffusing itself mysteriously in a crowded street sniffed for an instant and then lost again it s coffee he murmured real coffee it s inner party coffee there s a whole kilo here she said how did you manage to get hold of all these things it s all inner party stuff there s nothing those swine don t have nothing but of course waiters and servants and people pinch things and look i got a little packet of tea as well winston had squatted down beside her he tore open a corner of the packet it s real tea not blackberry leaves there s been a lot of tea about lately they ve captured india or something she said vaguely but listen dear i want you to turn your back on me for three minutes go and sit on the other side of the bed don t go too near the window and don t turn round till i tell you winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain down in the yard the red armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and the line she took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling they sye that time eals all things they sye you can always forget but the smiles an the tears acrorss the years they twist my eart strings yet she knew the whole drivelling song by heart it seemed her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air very tuneful charged with a sort of happy melancholy one had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content if the june evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible to remain there for a thousand years pegging out diapers and singing rubbish it struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the party singing alone and spontaneously it would even have seemed slightly unorthodox a dangerous eccentricity like talking to oneself perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about you can turn round now said julia he turned round and for a second almost failed to recognize her what he had actually expected was to see her naked but she was not naked the transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that she had painted her face she must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of make up materials her lips were deeply reddened her cheeks rouged her nose powdered there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter it was not very skilfully done but winston s standards in such matters were not high he had never before seen or imagined a woman of the party with cosmetics on her face the improvement in her appearance was startling with just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier but above all far more feminine her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect as he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils he remem bered the half darkness of a basement kitchen and a woman s cavernous mouth it was the very same scent that she had used but at the moment it did not seem to matter scent too he said yes dear scent too and do you know what i m going to do next i m going to get hold of a real woman s frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers i ll wear silk stockings and high heeled shoes in this room i m going to be a woman not a party comrade they flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed it was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle there were no sheets but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them it s sure to be full of bugs but who cares said julia one never saw a double bed nowadays except in the homes of the proles winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood julia had never been in one before so far as she could remember presently they fell asleep for a little while when winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine he did not stir because julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm most of her make up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone a yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace where the water in the pan was boiling fast down in the yard the woman had stopped singing but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this in the cool of a summer evening a man and a woman with no clothes on making love when they chose talking of what they chose not feeling any compulsion to get up simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary julia woke up rubbed her eyes and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove half that water s boiled away she said i ll get up and make some coffee in another moment we ve got an hour what time do they cut the lights off at your flats twenty three thirty it s twenty three at the hostel but you have to get in earlier than that because hi get out you filthy brute she suddenly twisted herself over in the bed seized a shoe from the floor and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at goldstein that morning during the two minutes hate what was it he said in surprise a rat i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting there s a hole down there i gave him a good fright anyway rats murmured winston in this room they re all over the place said julia indifferently as she lay down again we ve even got them in the kitchen at the hostel some parts of london are swarming with them did you know they attack children yes they do in some of these streets a woman daren t leave a baby alone for two minutes it s the great huge brown ones that do it and the nasty thing is that the brutes always don t go on said winston with his eyes tightly shut dearest you ve gone quite pale what s the matter do they make you feel sick of all horrors in the world a rat she pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body he did not reopen his eyes immediately for several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life it was always very much the same he was standing in front of a wall of darkness and on the other side of it there was something unendurable something too dreadful to be faced in the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self deception because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness with a deadly effort like wrenching a piece out of his own brain he could even have dragged the thing into the open he always woke up without discovering what it was but somehow it was connected with what julia had been saying when he cut her short i m sorry he said it s nothing i don t like rats that s all don t worry dear we re not going to have the filthy brutes in here i ll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go and next time we come here i ll bring some plaster and bung it up properly already the black instant of panic was half forgotten feeling slightly ashamed of himself he sat up against the bedhead julia got out of bed pulled on her overalls and made the coffee the smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive what was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar a thing winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine with one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other julia wandered about the room glancing indifferently at the bookcase pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table plumping herself down in the ragged arm chair to see if it was comfortable and examining the absurd twelve hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement she brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light he took it out of her hand fascinated as always by the soft rainwatery appearance of the glass what is it do you think said julia i don t think it s anything i mean i don t think it was ever put to any use that s what i like about it it s a little chunk of history that they ve forgotten to alter it s a message from a hundred years ago if one knew how to read it and that picture over there she nodded at the engraving on the opposite wall would that be a hundred years old more two hundred i dare say one can t tell it s impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays she went over to look at it here s where that brute stuck his nose out she said kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture what is this place i ve seen it before somewhere it s a church or at least it used to be st clement danes its name was the fragment of rhyme that mr charrington had taught him came back into his head and he added half nostalgically oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s to his astonishment she capped the line you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martin s when will you pay me say the bells of old bailey i can t remember how it goes on after that but anyway i remember it ends up here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head it was like the two halves of a countersign but there must be another line after the bells of old bailey perhaps it could be dug out of mr charrington s memory if he were suitably prompted who taught you that he said my grandfather he used to say it to me when i was a little girl he was vaporized when i was eight at any rate he disappeared i wonder what a lemon was she added inconsequently i ve seen oranges they re a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin i can remember lemons said winston they were quite common in the fifties they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them i bet that picture s got bugs behind it said julia i ll take it down and give it a good clean some day i suppose it s almost time we were leaving i must start washing this paint off what a bore i ll get the lipstick off your face afterwards winston did not get up for a few minutes more the room was darkening he turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight the inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself there was such a depth of it and yet it was almost as transparent as air it was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete he had the feeling that he could get inside it and that in fact he was inside it along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself the paperweight was the room he was in and the coral was julia s life and his own fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal x x x syme had vanished a morning came and he was missing from work a few thoughtless people commented on his absence on the next day nobody mentioned him on the third day winston went into the vestibule of the records department to look at the notice board one of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the chess committee of whom syme had been one it looked almost exactly as it had looked before nothing had been crossed out but it was one name shorter it was enough syme had ceased to exist he had never existed the weather was baking hot in the labyrinthine ministry the windowless air conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature but outside the pavements scorched one s feet and the stench of the tubes at the rush hours was a horror the preparations for hate week were in full swing and the staffs of all the ministries were working overtime processions meetings military parades lectures waxworks displays film shows telescreen programmes all had to be organized stands had to be erected effigies built slogans coined songs written rumours circulated photographs faked julia s unit in the fiction department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets winston in addition to his regular work spent long periods every day in going through back files of the times and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches late at night when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets the town had a curiously febrile air the rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours the new tune which was to be the theme song of hate week the hate song it was called had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens it had a savage barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music but resembled the beating of a drum roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet it was terrifying the proles had taken a fancy to it and in the midnight streets it competed with the still popular it was only a hopeless fancy the parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day unbearably on a comb and a piece of toilet paper winston s evenings were fuller than ever squads of volunteers organized by parsons were preparing the street for hate week stitching banners painting posters erecting flagstaffs on the roofs and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers parsons boasted that victory mansions alone would display four hundred metres of bunting he was in his native element and as happy as a lark the heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings he was everywhere at once pushing pulling sawing hammering improvising jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid smelling sweat a new poster had suddenly appeared all over london it had no caption and represented simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier three or four metres high striding forward with expressionless mongolian face and enormous boots a submachine gun pointed from his hip from whatever angle you looked at the poster the muzzle of the gun magnified by the foreshortening seemed to be pointed straight at you the thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall even outnumbering the portraits of big brother the proles normally apathetic about the war were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism as though to harmonize with the general mood the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual one fell on a crowded film theatre in stepney burying several hundred victims among the ruins the whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces there were further angry demonstrations goldstein was burned in effigy hundreds of copies of the poster of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation in the room over mr charrington s shop when they could get there julia and winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window naked for the sake of coolness the rat had never come back but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat it did not seem to matter dirty or clean the room was paradise as soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market tear off their clothes and make love with sweating bodies then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter attack four five six seven times they met during the month of june winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours he seemed to have lost the need for it he had grown fatter his varicose ulcer had subsided leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped the process of life had ceased to be intolerable he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice now that they had a secure hiding place almost a home it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time what mattered was that the room over the junk shop should exist to know that it was there inviolate was almost the same as being in it the room was a world a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk mr charrington thought winston was another extinct animal he usually stopped to talk with mr charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs the old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors and on the other hand to have almost no customers he led a ghostlike existence between the tiny dark shop and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained among other things an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn he seemed glad of the opportunity to talk wandering about among his worthless stock with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket he had always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman with a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that a china bottle stopper the painted lid of a broken snuffbox a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long dead baby s hair never asking that winston should buy it merely that he should admire it to talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn out musical box he had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes there was one about four and twenty blackbirds and another about a cow with a crumpled horn and another about the death of poor cock robin it just occurred to me you might be interested he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment but he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme both of them knew in a way it was never out of their minds that what was now happening
