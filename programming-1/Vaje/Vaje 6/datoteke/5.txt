could not last long there were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking but there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence so long as they were actually in this room they both felt no harm could come to them getting there was difficult and dangerous but the room itself was sanctuary it was as when winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world and that once inside it time could be arrested often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape their luck would hold indefinitely and they would carry on their intrigue just like this for the remainder of their natural lives or katharine would die and by subtle manoeuvrings winston and julia would succeed in getting married or they would commit suicide together or they would disappear alter themselves out of recognition learn to speak with proletarian accents get jobs in a factory and live out their lives undetected in a back street it was all nonsense as they both knew in reality there was no escape even the one plan that was practicable suicide they had no intention of carrying out to hang on from day to day and from week to week spinning out a present that had no future seemed an unconquerable instinct just as one s lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available sometimes too they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the party but with no notion of how to take the first step even if the fabulous brotherhood was a reality there still remained the difficulty of finding one s way into it he told her of the strange intimacy that existed or seemed to exist between himself and o brien and of the impulse he sometimes felt simply to walk into o brien s presence announce that he was the enemy of the party and demand his help curiously enough this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do she was used to judging people by their faces and it seemed natural to her that winston should believe o brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes moreover she took it for granted that everyone or nearly everyone secretly hated the party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so but she refused to believe that widespread organized opposition existed or could exist the tales about goldstein and his underground army she said were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in times beyond number at party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief when public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the youth league who surrounded the courts from morning to night chanting at intervals death to the traitors during the two minutes hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at goldstein yet she had only the dimmest idea of who goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent she had grown up since the revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination and in any case the party was invincible it would always exist and it would always be the same you could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or at most by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up in some ways she was far more acute than winston and far less susceptible to party propaganda once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against eurasia she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening the rocket bombs which fell daily on london were probably fired by the government of oceania itself just to keep people frightened this was an idea that had literally never occurred to him she also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the two minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing but she only questioned the teachings of the party when they in some way touched upon her own life often she was ready to accept the official mythology simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her she believed for instance having learnt it at school that the party had invented aeroplanes in his own schooldays winston remembered in the late fifties it was only the helicopter that the party claimed to have invented a dozen years later when julia was at school it was already claiming the aeroplane one generation more and it would be claiming the steam engine and when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the revolution the fact struck her as totally uninteresting after all what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes it was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that oceania four years ago had been at war with eastasia and at peace with eurasia it was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed i thought we d always been at war with eurasia she said vaguely it frightened him a little the invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth but the switchover in the war had happened only four years ago well after she was grown up he argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour in the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time eastasia and not eurasia had been the enemy but the issue still struck her as unimportant who cares she said impatiently it s always one bloody war after another and one knows the news is all lies anyway sometimes he talked to her of the records department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there such things did not appear to horrify her she did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths he told her the story of jones aaronson and rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers it did not make much impression on her at first indeed she failed to grasp the point of the story were they friends of yours she said no i never knew them they were inner party members besides they were far older men than i was they belonged to the old days before the revolution i barely knew them by sight then what was there to worry about people are being killed off all the time aren t they he tried to make her understand this was an exceptional case it wasn t just a question of somebody being killed do you realize that the past starting from yesterday has been actually abolished if it survives anywhere it s in a few solid objects with no words attached to them like that lump of glass there already we know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the years before the revolution every record has been destroyed or falsified every book has been rewritten every picture has been repainted every statue and street and building has been renamed every date has been altered and that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute history has stopped nothing exists except an endless present in which the party is always right i know of course that the past is falsified but it would never be possible for me to prove it even when i did the falsification myself after the thing is done no evidence ever remains the only evidence is inside my own mind and i don t know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories just in that one instance in my whole life i did possess actual concrete evidence after the event years after it and what good was that it was no good because i threw it away a few minutes later but if the same thing happened today i should keep it well i wouldn t said julia i m quite ready to take risks but only for something worth while not for bits of old newspaper what could you have done with it even if you had kept it not much perhaps but it was evidence it might have planted a few doubts here and there supposing that i d dared to show it to anybody i don t imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime but one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there small groups of people banding themselves together and gradually growing and even leaving a few records behind so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off i m not interested in the next generation dear i m interested in us you re only a rebel from the waist downwards he told her she thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight in the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest whenever he began to talk of the principles of ingsoc doublethink the mutability of the past and the denial of objective reality and to use newspeak words she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing one knew that it was all rubbish so why let oneself be worried by it she knew when to cheer and when to boo and that was all one needed if he persisted in talking of such subjects she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep she was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position talking to her he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant in a way the world view of the party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it they could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening by lack of understanding they remained sane they simply swallowed everything and what they swallowed did them no harm because it left no residue behind just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird x x x it had happened at last the expected message had come all his life it seemed to him he had been waiting for this to happen he was walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he was almost at the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him the person whoever it was gave a small cough evidently as a prelude to speaking winston stopped abruptly and turned it was o brien at last they were face to face and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away his heart bounded violently he would have been incapable of speaking o brien however had continued forward in the same movement laying a friendly hand for a moment on winston s arm so that the two of them were walking side by side he began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of inner party members i had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you he said i was reading one of your newspeak articles in the times the other day you take a scholarly interest in newspeak i believe winston had recovered part of his self possession hardly scholarly he said i m only an amateur it s not my subject i have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language but you write it very elegantly said o brien that is not only my own opinion i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert his name has slipped my memory for the moment again winston s heart stirred painfully it was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference to syme but syme was not only dead he was abolished an unperson any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous o brien s remark must obviously have been intended as a signal a codeword by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices they had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor but now o brien halted with the curious disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose then he went on what i had really intended to say was that in your article i noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete but they have only become so very recently have you seen the tenth edition of the newspeak dictionary no said winston i didn t think it had been issued yet we are still using the ninth in the records department the tenth edition is not due to appear for some months i believe but a few advance copies have been circulated i have one myself it might interest you to look at it perhaps very much so said winston immediately seeing where this tended some of the new developments are most ingenious the reduction in the number of verbs that is the point that will appeal to you i think let me see shall i send a messenger to you with the dictionary but i am afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you wait let me give you my address they were standing in front of a telescreen somewhat absentmindedly o brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather covered notebook and a gold ink pencil immediately beneath the telescreen in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing he scribbled an address tore out the page and handed it to winston i am usually at home in the evenings he said if not my servant will give you the dictionary he was gone leaving winston holding the scrap of paper which this time there was no need to conceal nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers they had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most there was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have it had been contrived as a way of letting winston know o brien s address this was necessary because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover where anyone lived there were no directories of any kind if you ever want to see me this is where i can be found was what o brien had been saying to him perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary but at any rate one thing was certain the conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist and he had reached the outer edges of it he knew that sooner or later he would obey o brien s summons perhaps tomorrow perhaps after a long delay he was not certain what was happening was only the working out of a process that had started years ago the first step had been a secret involuntary thought the second had been the opening of the diary he had moved from thoughts to words and now from words to actions the last step was something that would happen in the ministry of love he had accepted it the end was contained in the beginning but it was frightening or more exactly it was like a foretaste of death like being a little less alive even whiie he was speaking to o brien when the meaning of the words had sunk in a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body he had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him x x x winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears julia rolled sleepily against him murmuring something that might have been what s the matter i dreamt he began and stopped short it was too complex to be put into words there was the dream itself and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking he lay back with his eyes shut still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream it was a vast luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain it had all occurred inside the glass paperweight but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances the dream had also been comprehended by indeed in some sense it had consisted in a gesture of the arm made by his mother and made again thirty years later by the jewish woman he had seen on the news film trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets before the helicopter blew them both to pieces do you know he said that until this moment i believed i had murdered my mother why did you murder her said julia almost asleep i didn t murder her not physically in the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother and within a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all come back it was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over many years he was not certain of the date but he could not have been less than ten years old possibly twelve when it had happened his father had disappeared some time earlier how much earlier he could not remember he remembered better the rackety uneasy circumstances of the time the periodical panics about air raids and the sheltering in tube stations the piles of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour the enormous queues outside the bakeries the intermittent machine gun fire in the distance above all the fact that there was never enough to eat he remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves potato peelings sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed and which when they jolted over the bad patches in the road sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil cake when his father disappeared his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief but a sudden change came over her she seemed to have become completely spiritless it was evident even to winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen she did everything that was needed cooked washed mended made the bed swept the floor dusted the mantelpiece always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion like an artist s lay figure moving of its own accord her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness for hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed nursing his young sister a tiny ailing very silent child of two or three with a face made simian by thinness very occasionally she would take winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything he was aware in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness that this was somehow connected with the never mentioned thing that was about to happen he remembered the room where they lived a dark closesmelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane there was a gas ring in the fender and a shelf where food was kept and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink common to several rooms he remembered his mother s statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan above all he remembered his continuous hunger and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes he would ask his mother naggingly over and over again why there was not more food he would shout and storm at her he even remembered the tones of his voice which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share his mother was quite ready to give him more than his share she took it for granted that he the boy should have the biggest portion but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more at every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food but it was no use he would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands he would grab bits from his sister s plate he knew that he was starving the other two but he could not help it he even felt that he had a right to do it the clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him between meals if his mother did not stand guard he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf one day a chocolate ration was issued there had been no such issue for weeks or months past he remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate it was a two ounce slab they still talked about ounces in those days between the three of them it was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts suddenly as though he were listening to somebody else winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece his mother told him not to be greedy there was a long nagging argument that went round and round with shouts whines tears remonstrances bargainings his tiny sister clinging to her mother with both hands exactly like a baby monkey sat looking over her shoulder at him with large mournful eyes in the end his mother broke off three quarters of the chocolate and gave it to winston giving the other quarter to his sister the little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully perhaps not knowing what it was winston stood watching her for a moment then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister s hand and was fleeing for the door winston winston his mother called after him come back give your sister back her chocolate he stopped but did not come back his mother s anxious eyes were fixed on his face even now he was thinking about the thing he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening his sister conscious of having been robbed of something had set up a feeble wail his mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying he turned and fled down the stairs with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand he never saw his mother again after he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours until hunger drove him home when he came back his mother had disappeared this was already becoming normal at that time nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister they had not taken any clothes not even his mother s overcoat to this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead it was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced labour camp as for his sister she might have been removed like winston himself to one of the colonies for homeless children reclamation centres they were called which had grown up as a result of the civil war or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother or simply left somewhere or other to die the dream was still vivid in his mind especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained his mind went back to another dream of two months ago exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child clinging to her so she had sat in the sunken ship far underneath him and drowning deeper every minute but still looking up at him through the darkening water he told julia the story of his mother s disappearance without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position i expect you were a beastly little swine in those days she said indistinctly all children are swine yes but the real point of the story from her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again he would have liked to continue talking about his mother he did not suppose from what he could remember of her that she had been an unusual woman still less an intelligent one and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility a kind of purity simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones her feelings were her own and could not be altered from outside it would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless if you loved someone you loved him and when you had nothing else to give you still gave him love when the last of the chocolate was gone his mother had clasped the child in her arms it was no use it changed nothing it did not produce more chocolate it did not avert the child s death or her own but it seemed natural to her to do it the refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper the terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses mere feelings were of no account while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world when once you were in the grip of the party what you felt or did not feel what you did or refrained from doing made literally no difference whatever happened you vanished and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again you were lifted clean out of the stream of history and yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all important because they were not attempting to alter history they were governed by private loyalties which they did not question what mattered were individual relationships and a completely helpless gesture an embrace a tear a word spoken to a dying man could have value in itself the proles it suddenly occurred to him had remained in this condition they were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea they were loyal to one another for the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world the proles had stayed human they had not become hardened inside they had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re learn by conscious effort and in thinking this he remembered without apparent relevance how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage stalk the proles are human beings he said aloud we are not human why not said julia who had woken up again he thought for a little while has it ever occurred to you he said that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before it s too late and never see each other again yes dear it has occurred to me several times but i m not going to do it all the same we ve been lucky he said but it can t last much longer you re young you look normal and innocent if you keep clear of people like me you might stay alive for another fifty years no i ve thought it all out what you do i m going to do and don t be too downhearted i m rather good at staying alive we may be together for another six months a year there s no knowing at the end we re certain to be apart do you realize how utterly alone we shall be when once they get hold of us there will be nothing literally nothing that either of us can do for the other if i confess they ll shoot you and if i refuse to confess they ll shoot you just the same nothing that i can do or say or stop myself from saying will put off your death for as much as five minutes neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead we shall be utterly without power of any kind the one thing that matters is that we shouldn t betray one another although even that can t make the slightest difference if you mean confessing she said we shall do that right enough everybody always confesses you can t help it they torture you i don t mean confessing confession is not betrayal what you say or do doesn t matter only feelings matter if they could make me stop loving you that would be the real betrayal she thought it over they can t do that she said finally it s the one thing they can t do they can make you say anything any thing but they can t make you believe it they can t get inside you no he said a little more hopefully no that s quite true they can t get inside you if you can feel that staying human is worth while even when it can t have any result whatever you ve beaten them he thought of the telescreen with its never sleeping ear they could spy upon you night and day but if you kept your head you could still outwit them with all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands one did not know what happened inside the ministry of love but it was possible to guess tortures drugs delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions gradual wearing down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning facts at any rate could not be kept hidden they could be tracked down by enquiry they could be squeezed out of you by torture but if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human what difference did it ultimately make they could not alter your feelings for that matter you could not alter them yourself even if you wanted to they could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought but the inner heart whose workings were mysterious even to yourself remained impregnable x x x they had done it they had done it at last the room they were standing in was long shaped and softly lit the telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur the richness of the dark blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet at the far end of the room o brien was sitting at a table under a green shaded lamp with a mass of papers on either side of him he had not bothered to look up when the servant showed julia and winston in winston s heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak they had done it they had done it at last was all he could think it had been a rash act to come here at all and sheer folly to arrive together though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on o brien s doorstep but merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve it was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling places of the inner party or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived the whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats the richness and spaciousness of everything the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down the white jacketed servants hurrying to and fro everything was intimidating although he had a good pretext for coming here he was haunted at every step by the fear that a black uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner demand his papers and order him to get out o brien s servant however had admitted the two of them without demur he was a small dark haired man in a white jacket with a diamond shaped completely expressionless face which might have been that of a chinese the passage down which he led them was softly carpeted with cream papered walls and white wainscoting all exquisitely clean that too was intimidating winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies o brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently his heavy face bent down so that one could see the line of the nose looked both formidable and intelligent for perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the ministries items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end message he rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet a little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the newspeak words but his expression was grimmer than usual as though he were not pleased at being disturbed the terror that winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake for what evidence had he in reality that o brien was any kind of political conspirator nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark beyond that only his own secret imaginings founded on a dream he could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary because in that case julia s presence was impossible to explain as o brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him he stopped turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall there was a sharp snap the voice had stopped julia uttered a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surprise even in the midst of his panic winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue you can turn it off he said yes said o brien we can turn it off we have that privilege he was opposite them now his solid form towered over the pair of them and the expression on his face was still indecipherable he was waiting somewhat sternly for winston to speak but about what even now it was quite conceivabie that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted nobody spoke after the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent the seconds marched past enormous with difficulty winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on o brien s then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile with his characteristic gesture o brien resettled his spectacles on his nose shall i say it or will you he said i will say it said winston promptly that thing is really turned off yes everything is turned off we are alone we have come here because he paused realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from o brien it was not easy to say why he had come here he went on conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious we believe that there is some kind of conspiracy some kind of secret organization working against the party and that you are involved in it we want to join it and work for it we are enemies of the party we disbelieve in the principles of ingsoc we are thought criminals we are also adulterers i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way we are ready he stopped and glanced over his shoulder with the feeling that the door had opened sure enough the little yellow faced servant had come in without knocking winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses martin is one of us said o brien impassively bring the drinks over here martin put them on the round table have we enough chairs then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort bring a chair for yourself martin this is business you can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes the little man sat down quite at his ease and yet still with a servant like air the air of a valet enjoying a privilege winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye it struck him that the man s whole life was playing a part and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment o brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark red liquid it aroused in winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass seen from the top the stuff looked almost black but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby it had a sour sweet smell he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity it is called wine said o brien with a faint smile you will have read about it in books no doubt not much of it gets to the outer party i am afraid his face grew solemn again and he raised his glass i think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health to our leader to emmanuel goldstein winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about like the glass paperweight or mr charrington s half remembered rhymes it belonged to the vanished romantic past the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts for some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect actually when he came to swallow it the stuff was distinctly disappointing the truth was that after years of gin drinking he could barely taste it he set down the empty glass then there is such a person as goldstein he said yes there is such a person and he is alive where i do not know and the conspiracy the organization is it real it is not simply an invention of the thought police no it is real the brotherhood we call it you will never learn much more about the brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it i will come back to that presently he looked at his wrist watch it is unwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour you ought not to have come here together and you will have to leave separately you comrade he bowed his head to julia will leave first we have about twenty minutes at our disposal you will understand that i must start by asking you certain questions in general terms what are you prepared to do anything that we are capable of said winston o brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing winston he almost ignored julia seeming to take it for granted that winston could speak for her for a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes he began asking his questions in a low expressionless voice as though this were a routine a sort of catechism most of whose answers were known to him already you are prepared to give your lives yes you are prepared to commit murder yes to commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people yes to betray your country to foreign powers yes you are prepared to cheat to forge to blackmail to corrupt the minds of children to distribute habit forming drugs to encourage prostitution to disseminate venereal diseases to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the party yes if for example it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child s face are you prepared to do that yes you are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dock worker yes you are prepared to commit suicide if and when we order you to do so yes you are prepared the two of you to separate and never see one another again no broke in julia it appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered for a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech his tongue worked soundlessly forming the opening syllables first of one word then of the other over and over again until he had said it he did not know which word he was going to say no he said finally you did well to tell me said o brien it is necessary for us to know everything he turned himself toward julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it do you understand that even if he survives it may be as a different person we may be obliged to give him a new identity his face his movements the shape of his hands the colour of his hair even his voice would be different and you yourself might have become a different person our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition sometimes it is necessary sometimes we even amputate a limb winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at martin s mongolian face there were no scars that he could see julia had turned a shade paler so that her freckles were showing but she faced o brien boldly she murmured something that seemed to be assent good then that is settled there was a silver box of cigarettes on the table with a rather absent minded air o brien pushed them towards the others took one himself then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro as though he could think better standing they were very good cigarettes very thick and well packed with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper o brien looked at his wrist watch again you had better go back to your pantry martin he said i shall switch on in a quarter of an hour take a good look at these comrades faces before you go you will be seeing them again i may not exactly as they had done at the front door the little man s dark eyes flickered over their faces there was not a trace of friendliness in his manner he was memorizing their appearance but he felt no interest in them or appeared to feel none it occurred to winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression without speaking or giving any kind of salutation martin went out closing the door silently behind him o brien was strolling up and down one hand in the pocket of his black overalls the other holding his cigarette you understand he said that you will be fighting in the dark you will always be in the dark you will receive orders and you will obey them without knowing why later i shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in and the strategy by which we shall destroy it when you have read the book you will be full members of the brotherhood but between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immedi ate tasks of the moment you will never know anything i tell you that the brotherhood exists but i cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members or ten million from your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen you will have three or four contacts who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear as this was your first contact it will be preserved when you receive orders they will come from me if we find it necessary to communicate with you it will be through martin when you are finally caught you will confess that is unavoidable but you will have very little to confess other than your own actions you will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people probably you will not even betray me by that time i may be dead or i shall have become a different person with a different face he continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet in spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements it came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket or manipulated a cigarette more even than of strength he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony however much in earnest he might be he had nothing of the single mindedness that belongs to a fanatic when he spoke of murder suicide venereal disease amputated limbs and altered faces it was with a faint air of persiflage this is unavoidable his voice seemed to say this is what we have got to do unflinchingly but this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again a wave of admiration almost of worship flowed out from winston towards o brien for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of goldstein when you looked at o brien s powerful shoulders and his blunt featured face so ugly and yet so civilized it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated there was no stratagem that he was not equal to no danger that he could not foresee even julia seemed to be impressed she had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently o brien went on you will have heard rumours of the existence of the brotherhood no doubt you have formed your own picture of it you have imagined probably a huge underworld of conspirators meeting secretly in cellars scribbling messages on walls recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand nothing of the kind exists the members of the brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others goldstein himself if he fell into the hands of the thought police could not give them a complete list of members or any information that would lead them to a complete list no such list exists the brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible you will never have anything to sustain you except the idea you will get no comradeship and no encouragement when finally you are caught you will get no help we never help our members at most when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner s cell you will have to get used to living without results and without hope you will work for a while you will be caught you will confess and then you will die those are the only results that you will ever see there is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime we are the dead our only true life is in the future we shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone but how far away that future may be there is no knowing it might be a thousand years at present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little we cannot act collectively we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual generation after generation in the face of the thought police there is no other way he halted and looked for the third time at his wrist watch it is almost time for you to leave comrade he said to julia wait the decanter is still half full he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem what shall it be this time he said still with the same faint suggestion of irony to the confusion of the thought police to the death of big brother to humanity to the future to the past said winston the past is more important agreed o brien gravely they emptied their glasses and a moment later julia stood up to go o brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue it was important he said not to go out smelling of wine the lift attendants were very observant as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence he took another pace or two up and down then stopped there are details to be settled he said i assume that you have a hiding place of some kind winston explained about the room over mr charrington s shop that will do for the moment later we will arrange something else for you it is important to change one s hiding place frequently meanwhile i shall send you a copy of the book even o brien winston noticed seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics goldstein s book you understand as soon as possible it may be some days before i can get hold of one there are not many in existence as you can imagine the thought police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them it makes very little difference the book is indestructible if the last copy were gone we could reproduce it almost word for word do you carry a brief case to work with you he added as a rule yes what is it like black very shabby with two straps black two straps very shabby good one day in the fairly near future i cannot give a date one of the messages among your morning s work will contain a misprinted word and you will have to ask for a repeat on the following day you will go to work without your brief case at some time during the day in the street a man will touch you on the arm and say i think you have dropped your brief case the one he gives you will contain a copy of goldstein s book you will return it within fourteen days they were silent for a moment there are a couple of minutes before you need go said o brien we shall meet again if we do meet again winston looked up at him in the place where there is no darkness he said hesitantly o brien nodded without appearance of surprise in the place where there is no darkness he said as though he had recognized the allusion and in the meantime is there anything that you wish to say before you leave any message any question winston thought there did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask still less did he feel any impulse to utter high sounding generalities instead of anything directly connected with o brien or the brotherhood there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days and the little room over mr charrington s shop and the glass paperweight and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame almost at random he said did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s again o brien nodded with a sort of grave courtesy he completed the stanza oranges and lemons say the bells of st clement s you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martin s when will you pay me say the bells of old bailey when i grow rich say the bells of shoreditch you knew the last line said winston yes i knew the last line and now i am afraid it is time for you to go but wait you had better let me give you one of these tablets as winston stood up o brien held out a hand his powerful grip crushed the bones of winston s palm at the door winston looked back but o brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind he was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen beyond him winston could see the writing table with its green shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep laden with papers the incident was closed within thirty seconds it occurred to him o brien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the party x x x winston was gelatinous with fatigue gelatinous was the right word it had come into his head spontaneously his body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly but its translucency he felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it all the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work leaving only a frail structure of nerves bones and skin all sensations seemed to be magnified his overalls fretted his shoulders the pavement tickled his feet even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak he had worked more than ninety hours in five days so had everyone else in the ministry now it was all over and he had literally nothing to do no party work of any description until tomorrow morning he could spend six hours in the hiding place and another nine in his own bed slowly in mild afternoon sunshine he walked up a dingy street in the direction of mr charrington s shop keeping one eye open for the patrols but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him the heavy brief case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg inside it was the book which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened nor even looked at on the sixth day of hate week after the processions the speeches the shouting the singing the banners the posters the films the waxworks the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets the tramp of marching feet the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks the roar of massed planes the booming of guns after six days of this when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the eurasian war criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces at just this moment it had been announced that oceania was not after all at war with eurasia oceania was at war with eastasia eurasia was an ally there was of course no admission that any change had taken place merely it became known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that eastasia and not eurasia was the enemy winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london squares at the moment when it happened it was night and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit the square was packed with several thousand people including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the spies on a scarlet draped platform an orator of the inner party a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull
