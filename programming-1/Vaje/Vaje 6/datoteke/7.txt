older kind of socialist who had been trained to fight against something called class privilege assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent he did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholic church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years the essence of oligarchical rule is not father to son inheritance but the persistence of a certain world view and a certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself who wields power is not important provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same all the beliefs habits tastes emotions mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of present day society from being perceived physical rebellion or any preliminary move towards rebellion is at present not possible from the proletarians nothing is to be feared left to themselves they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century working breeding and dying not only without any impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is they could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly but since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important the level of popu lar education is actually declining what opinions the masses hold or do not hold is looked on as a matter of indifference they can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect in a party member on the other hand not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated a party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thought police even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone wherever he may be asleep or awake working or resting in his bath or in bed he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected nothing that he does is indifferent his friendships his relaxations his behaviour towards his wife and children the expression of his face when he is alone the words he mutters in sleep even the characteristic movements of his body are all jealously scrutinized not only any actual misdemeanour but any eccentricity however small any change of habits any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle is certain to be detected he has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever on the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour in oceania there is no law thoughts and actions which when detected mean certain death are not formally forbidden and the endless purges arrests tortures imprisonments and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed but are merely the wiping out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future a party member is required to have not only the right opinions but the right instincts many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in ingsoc if he is a person naturally orthodox in newspeak a goodthinker he will in all circumstances know without taking thought what is the true belief or the desirable emotion but in any case an elaborate mental training undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the newspeak words crimestop blackwhite and doublethink makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever a party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm he is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors triumph over victories and selfabasement before the power and wisdom of the party the discontents produced by his bare unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the two minutes hate and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline the first and simplest stage in the discipline which can be taught even to young children is called in newspeak crimestop crimestop means the faculty of stopping short as though by instinct at the threshold of any dangerous thought it includes the power of not grasping analogies of failing to perceive logical errors of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to ingsoc and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction crimestop in short means protective stupidity but stupidity is not enough on the contrary orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one s own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is omnipotent and that the party is infallible but since in reality big brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible there is need for an unwearying moment to moment flexibility in the treatment of facts the keyword here is blackwhite like so many newspeak words this word has two mutually contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white in contradiction of the plain facts applied to a party member it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when party discipline demands this but it means also the ability to believe that black is white and more to know that black is white and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary this demands a continuous alteration of the past made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest and which is known in newspeak as doublethink the alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons one of which is subsidiary and so to speak precautionary the subsidiary reason is that the party member like the proletarian tolerates present day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison he must be cut off from the past just as he must be cut off from foreign countries because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party it is not merely that speeches statistics and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the party were in all cases right it is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted for to change one s mind or even one s policy is a confession of weakness if for example eurasia or eastasia whichever it may be is the enemy today then that country must always have been the enemy and if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered thus history is continuously rewritten this day to day falsification of the past carried out by the ministry of truth is as necessary to the stability of the re gime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the ministry of love the mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc past events it is argued have no objective existence but survive only in written records and in human memories the past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon and since the party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members it follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it it also follows that though the past is alterable it never has been altered in any specific instance for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment then this new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed this holds good even when as often happens the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now it will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act but it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner and if it is necessary to rearrange one s memories or to tamper with written records then it is necessary to forget that one has done so the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique it is learned by the majority of party members and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox in oldspeak it is called quite frankly reality control in newspeak it is called doublethink though doublethink comprises much else as well doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one s mind simultaneously and accepting both of them the party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated the process has to be conscious or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision but it also has to be unconscious or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact that has become inconvenient and then when it becomes necessary again to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies all this is indispensably necessary even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink for by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge and so on indefinitely with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been able and may for all we know continue to be able for thousands of years to arrest the course of history all past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft either they became stupid and arrogant failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances and were overthrown or they became liberal and cowardly made concessions when they should have used force and once again were overthrown they fell that is to say either through consciousness or through unconsciousness it is the achievement of the party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously and upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the party be made permanent if one is to rule and to continue ruling one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality for the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one s own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes it need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating in our society those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is in general the greater the understanding the greater the delusion the more intelligent the less sane one clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories to these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them they are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones the slightly more favoured workers whom we call the proles are only intermittently conscious of the war when it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening it is in the ranks of the party and above all of the inner party that the true war enthusiasm is found world conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible this peculiar linking together of opposites knowledge with ignorance cynicism with fanaticism is one of the chief distinguishing marks of oceanic society the official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them thus the party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the socialist movement originally stood and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism it preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason it systematically undermines the solidarity of the family and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty even the names of the four ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts the ministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry of truth with lies the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation these contradictions are not accidental nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy they are deliberate exercises in doublethink for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken if human equality is to be for ever averted if the high as we have called them are to keep their places permanently then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity but there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored it is why should human equality be averted supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described what is the motive for this huge accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time here we reach the central secret as we have seen the mystique of the party and above all of the inner party depends upon doublethink but deeper than this lies the original motive the never questioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink the thought police continuous warfare and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards this motive really consists winston became aware of silence as one becomes aware of a new sound it seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past she was lying on her side naked from the waist upwards with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly julia no answer julia are you awake no answer she was asleep he shut the book put it carefully on the floor lay down and pulled the coverlet over both of them he had still he reflected not learned the ultimate secret he understood how he did not understand why chapter i like chapter iii had not actually told him anything that he did not know it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already but after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad being in a minority even a minority of one did not make you mad there was truth and there was untruth and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world you were not mad a yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow he shut his eyes the sun on his face and the girl s smooth body touching his own gave him a strong sleepy confident feeling he was safe everything was all right he fell asleep murmuring sanity is not statistical with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom when he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time but a glance at the old fashioned clock told him that it was only twenty thirty he lay dozing for a while then the usual deep lunged singing struck up from the yard below it was only an opeless fancy it passed like an ipril dye but a look an a word an the dreams they stirred they ave stolen my eart awye the driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity you still heard it all over the place it had outlived the hate song julia woke at the sound stretched herself luxuriously and got out of bed i m hungry she said let s make some more coffee damn the stove s gone out and the water s cold she picked the stove up and shook it there s no oil in it we can get some from old charrington i expect the funny thing is i made sure it was full i m going to put my clothes on she added it seems to have got colder winston also got up and dressed himself the indefatigable voice sang on they sye that time eals all things they sye you can always forget but the smiles an the tears acrorss the years they twist my eart strings yet as he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window the sun must have gone down behind the houses it was not shining into the yard any longer the flagstones were wet as though they had just been washed and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too so fresh and pale was the blue between the chimney pots tirelessly the woman marched to and fro corking and uncorking herself singing and falling silent and pegging out more diapers and more and yet more he wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren julia had come across to his side together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below as he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude her thick arms reaching up for the line her powerful mare like buttocks protruded it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful it had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing then hardened roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over ripe turnip could be beautiful but it was so and after all he thought why not the solid contourless body like a block of granite and the rasping red skin bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose hip to the rose why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower she s beautiful he murmured she s a metre across the hips easily said julia that is her style of beauty said winston he held julia s supple waist easily encircled by his arm from the hip to the knee her flank was against his out of their bodies no child would ever come that was the one thing they could never do only by word of mouth from mind to mind could they pass on the secret the woman down there had no mind she had only strong arms a warm heart and a fertile belly he wondered how many children she had given birth to it might easily be fifteen she had had her momentary flowering a year perhaps of wild rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse and then her life had been laundering scrubbing darning cooking sweeping polishing mending scrubbing laundering first for children then for grandchildren over thirty unbroken years at the end of it she was still singing the mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale cloudless sky stretching away behind the chimney pots into interminable distance it was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody in eurasia or eastasia as well as here and the people under the sky were also very much the same everywhere all over the world hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this people ignorant of one another s existence held apart by walls of hatred and lies and yet almost exactly the same people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world if there was hope it lay in the proles without having read to the end of the book he knew that that must be goldstein s final message the future belonged to the proles and could he be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him winston smith as the world of the party yes because at the least it would be a world of sanity where there is equality there can be sanity sooner or later it would happen strength would change into consciousness the proles were immortal you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard in the end their awakening would come and until that happened though it might be a thousand years they would stay alive against all the odds like birds passing on from body to body the vitality which the party did not share and could not kill do you remember he said the thrush that sang to us that first day at the edge of the wood he wasn t singing to us said julia he was singing to please himself not even that he was just singing the birds sang the proles sang the party did not sing all round the world in london and new york in africa and brazil and in the mysterious forbidden lands beyond the frontiers in the streets of paris and berlin in the villages of the endless russian plain in the bazaars of china and japan everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure made monstrous by work and childbearing toiling from birth to death and still singing out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come you were the dead theirs was the future but you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four we are the dead he said we are the dead echoed julia dutifully you are the dead said an iron voice behind them they sprang apart winston s entrails seemed to have turned into ice he could see the white all round the irises of julia s eyes her face had turned a milky yellow the smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath you are the dead repeated the iron voice it was behind the picture breathed julia it was behind the picture said the voice remain exactly where you are make no movement until you are ordered it was starting it was starting at last they could do nothing except stand gazing into one another s eyes to run for life to get out of the house before it was too late no such thought occurred to them unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall there was a snap as though a catch had been turned back and a crash of breaking glass the picture had fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it now they can see us said julia now we can see you said the voice stand out in the middle of the room stand back to back clasp your hands behind your heads do not touch one another they were not touching but it seemed to him that he could feel julia s body shaking or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own he could just stop his teeth from chattering but his knees were beyond his control there was a sound of trampling boots below inside the house and outside the yard seemed to be full of men something was being dragged across the stones the woman s singing had stopped abruptly there was a long rolling clang as though the washtub had been flung across the yard and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain the house is surrounded said winston the house is surrounded said the voice he heard julia snap her teeth together i suppose we may as well say good bye she said you may as well say good bye said the voice and then another quite different voice a thin cultivated voice which winston had the impression of having heard before struck in and by the way while we are on the subject here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head something crashed on to the bed behind winston s back the head of a ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame someone was climbing through the window there was a stampede of boots up the stairs the room was full of solid men in black uniforms with iron shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands winston was not trembling any longer even his eyes he barely moved one thing alone mattered to keep still to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you a man with a smooth prizefighter s jowl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger winston met his eyes the feeling of nakedness with one s hands behind one s head and one s face and body all exposed was almost unbearable the man protruded the tip of a white tongue licked the place where his lips should have been and then passed on there was another crash someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth stone the fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake rolled across the mat how small thought winston how small it always was there was a gasp and a thump behind him and he received a violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance one of the men had smashed his fist into julia s solar plexus doubling her up like a pocket ruler she was thrashing about on the floor fighting for breath winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre but sometimes her livid gasping face came within the angle of his vision even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath he knew what it was like the terrible agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders and carried her out of the room like a sack winston had a glimpse of her face upside down yellow and contorted with the eyes shut and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek and that was the last he saw of her he stood dead still no one had hit him yet thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind he wondered whether they had got mr charrington he wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard he noticed that he badly wanted to urinate and felt a faint surprise because he had done so only two or three hours ago he noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine meaning twenty one but the light seemed too strong would not the light be fading at twenty one hours on an august evening he wondered whether after all he and julia had mistaken the time had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty thirty when really it was nought eight thirty on the following morning but he did not pursue the thought further it was not interesting there ws another lighter step in the passage mr charrington came into the room the demeanour of the black uniformed men suddenly became more subdued something had also changed in mr charrington s appearance his eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight pick up those pieces he said sharply a man stooped to obey the cockney accent had disappeared winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen mr charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket but his hair which had been almost white had turned black also he was not wearing his spectacles he gave winston a single sharp glance as though verifying his identity and then paid no more attention to him he was still recognizable but he was not the same person any longer his body had straightened and seemed to have grown bigger his face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation the black eyebrows were less bushy the wrinkles were gone the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered even the nose seemed shorter it was the alert cold face of a man of about five and thirty it occurred to winston that for the first time in his life he was looking with knowledge at a member of the thought police chapter three x x x he did not know where he was presumably he was in the ministry of love but there was no way of making certain he was in a high ceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain concealed lamps flooded it with cold light and there was a low steady humming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply a bench or shelf just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall broken only by the door and at the end opposite the door a lavatory pan with no wooden seat there were four telescreens one in each wall there was a dull aching in his belly it had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away but he was also hungry with a gnawing unwholesome kind of hunger it might be twenty four hours since he had eaten it might be thirty six he still did not know probably never would know whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him since he was arrested he had not been fed he sat as still as he could on the narrow bench with his hands crossed on his knee he had already learned to sit still if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen but the craving for food was growing upon him what he longed for above all was a piece of bread he had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls it was even possible he thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his leg that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there in the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear he slipped a hand into his pocket smith yelled a voice from the telescreen smith w hands out of pockets in the cells he sat still again his hands crossed on his knee before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock up used by the patrols he did not know how long he had been there some hours at any rate with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time it was a noisy evil smelling place they had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people the majority of them were common criminals but there were a few political prisoners among them he had sat silent against the wall jostled by dirty bodies too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the party prisoners and the others the party prisoners were always silent and terrified but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody they yelled insults at the guards fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded wrote obscene words on the floor ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding places in their clothes and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore order on the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards called them by nicknames and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole in the door the guards too treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance even when they had to handle them roughly there was much talk about the forced labour camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent it was all right in the camps he gathered so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes there was bribery favouritism and racketeering of every kind there was homosexuality and prostitution there was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes the positions of trust were given only to the common criminals especially the gangsters and the murderers who formed a sort of aristocracy all the dirty jobs were done by the politicals there was a constant come and go of prisoners of every description drug peddlers thieves bandits black marketeers drunks prostitutes some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them an enormous wreck of a woman aged about sixty with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles was carried in kicking and shouting by four guards who had hold of her one at each corner they wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them and dumped her down across winston s lap almost breaking his thigh bones the woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of f bastards then noticing that she was sitting on something uneven she slid off winston s knees on to the bench beg pardon dearie she said i wouldn t a sat on you only the buggers put me there they dono ow to treat a lady do they she paused patted her breast and belched pardon she said i ain t meself quite she leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor thass better she said leaning back with closed eyes never keep it down thass what i say get it up while it s fresh on your stomach like she revived turned to have another look at winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him she put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him towards her breathing beer and vomit into his face wass your name dearie she said smith said winston smith said the woman thass funny my name s smith too why she added sentimentally i might be your mother she might thought winston be his mother she was about the right age and physique and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced labour camp no one else had spoken to him to a surprising extent the ordinary criminals ignored the party prisoners the polits they called them with a sort of uninterested contempt the party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody and above all of speaking to one another only once when two party members both women were pressed close together on the bench he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly whispered words and in particular a reference to something called room one ohone which he did not understand it might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here the dull pain in his belly never went away but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly when it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself and of his desire for food when it grew better panic took hold of him there were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped he felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron shod boots on his shins he saw himself grovelling on the floor screaming for mercy through broken teeth he hardly thought of julia he could not fix his mind on her he loved her and would not betray her but that was only a fact known as he knew the rules of arithmetic he felt no love for her and he hardly even wondered what was happening to her he thought oftener of o brien with a flickering hope o brien might know that he had been arrested the brotherhood he had said never tried to save its members but there was the razor blade they would send the razor blade if they could there would be perhaps five seconds before the guard could rush into the cell the blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone everything came back to his sick body which shrank trembling from the smallest pain he was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance it was more natural to exist from moment to moment accepting another ten minutes life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell it should have been easy but he always lost count at some point or another more often he wondered where he was and what time of day it was at one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness in this place he knew instinctively the lights would never be turned out it was the place with no darkness he saw now why o brien had seemed to recognize the allusion in the ministry of love there were no windows his cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall it might be ten floors below ground or thirty above it he moved himself mentally from place to place and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground there was a sound of marching boots outside the steel door opened with a clang a young officer a trim black uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather and whose pale straight featured face was like a wax mask stepped smartly through the doorway he motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading the poet ampleforth shambled into the cell the door clanged shut again ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of and then began to wander up and down the cell he had not yet noticed winston s presence his troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the level of winston s head he was shoeless large dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks he was also several days away from a shave a scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones giving him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy he must speak to ampleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen it was even conceivable that ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade ampleforth he said there was no yell from the telescreen ampleforth paused mildly startled his eyes focused themselves slowly on winston ah smith he said you too what are you in for to tell you the truth he sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite winston there is only one offence is there not he said and have you committed it apparently i have he put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment as though trying to remember something these things happen he began vaguely i have been able to recall one instance a possible instance it was an indiscretion undoubtedly we were producing a definitive edition of the poems of kipling i allowed the word god to remain at the end of a line i could not help it he added almost indignantly raising his face to look at winston it was impossible to change the line the rhyme was rod do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to rod in the entire language for days i had racked my brains there was no other rhyme the expression on his face changed the annoyance passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased a sort of intellectual warmth the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact shone through the dirt and scrubby hair has it ever occurred to you he said that the whole history of english poetry has been determined by the fact that the english language lacks rhymes no that particular thought had never occurred to winston nor in the circumstances did it strike him as very important or interesting do you know what time of day it is he said ampleforth looked startled again i had hardly thought about it they arrested me it could be two days ago perhaps three his eyes flitted round the walls as though he half expected to find a window somewhere there is no difference between night and day in this place i do not see how one can calculate the time they talked desultorily for some minutes then without apparent reason a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent winston sat quietly his hands crossed ampleforth too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench fidgeted from side to side clasping his lank hands first round one knee then round the other the telescreen barked at him to keep still time passed twenty minutes an hour it was difficult to judge once more there was a sound of boots outside winston s entrails contracted soon very soon perhaps in five minutes perhaps now the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come the door opened the cold faced young officer stepped into the cell with a brief movement of the hand he indicated ampleforth room he said ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards his face vaguely perturbed but uncomprehending what seemed like a long time passed the pain in winston s belly had revived his mind sagged round and round on the same trick like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots he had only six thoughts the pain in his belly a piece of bread the blood and the screaming o brien julia the razor blade there was another spasm in his entrails the heavy boots were approaching as the door opened the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat parsons walked into the cell he was wearing khaki shorts and a sports shirt this time winston was startled into self forgetfulness you here he said parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise but only misery he began walking jerkily up and down evidently unable to keep still each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were trembling his eyes had a wide open staring look as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance what are you in for said winston thoughtcrime said parsons almost blubbering the tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself he paused opposite winston and began eagerly appealing to him you don t think they ll shoot me do you old chap they don t shoot you if you haven t actually done anything only thoughts which you can t help i know they give you a fair hearing oh i trust them for that they ll know my record won t they you know what kind of chap i was not a bad chap in my way not brainy of course but keen i tried to do my best for the party didn t i i ll get off with five years don t you think or even ten years a chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a labour camp they wouldn t shoot me for going off the rails just once are you guilty said winston of course i m guilty cried parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen you don t think the party would arrest an innocent man do you his frog like face grew calmer and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing old man he said sententiously it s insidious it can get hold of you without your even knowing it do you know how it got hold of me in my sleep yes that s a fact there i was working away trying to do my bit never knew i had any bad stuff in my mind at all and then i started talking in my sleep do you know what they heard me saying he sank his voice like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter an obscenity down with big brother yes i said that said it over and over again it seems between you and me old man i m glad they got me before it went any further do you know what i m going to say to them when i go up before the tribunal thank you i m going to say thank you for saving me before it was too late who denounced you said winston it was my little daughter said parsons with a sort of doleful pride she listened at the keyhole heard what i was saying and nipped off to the patrols the very next day pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh i don t bear her any grudge for it in fact i m proud of her it shows i brought her up in the right spirit anyway he made a few more jerky movements up and down several times casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan then he suddenly ripped down his shorts excuse me old man he said i can t help it it s the waiting he plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan winston covered his face with his hands smith yelled the voice from the telescreen smith w uncover your face no faces covered in the cells winston uncovered his face parsons used the lavatory loudly and abundantly it then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards parsons was removed more prisoners came and went mysteriously one a woman was consigned to room and winston noticed seemed to shrivel and turn a different colour when she heard the words a time came when if it had been morning when he was brought here it would be afternoon or if it had been afternoon then it would be midnight there were six prisoners in the cell men and women all sat very still opposite winston there sat a man with a chinless toothy face exactly like that of some large harmless rodent his fat mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there his pale grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone s eye the door opened and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through winston he was a commonplace mean looking man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind but what was startling was the emaciation of his face it was like a skull because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody or something the man sat down on the bench at a little distance from winston winston did not look at him again but the tormented skull like face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes suddenly he realized what was the matter the man was dying of starvation the same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell there was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench the eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull faced man then turning guiltily away then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction presently he began to fidget on his seat at last he stood up waddled clumsily across the cell dug down into the pocket of his overalls and with an abashed air held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull faced man there was a furious deafening roar from the telescreen the chinless man jumped in his tracks the skull faced man had quickly thrust his hands behind his back as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift bumstead roared the voice bumstead j let fall that piece of bread the chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor remain standing where you are said the voice face the door make no movement the chinless man obeyed his large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably the door clanged open as the young officer entered and stepped aside there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulders he took his stand opposite the chinless man and then at a signal from the officer let free a frightful blow with all the weight of his body behind it full in the chinless man s mouth the force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor his body was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat for a moment he lay as though stunned with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose a very faint whimpering or squeaking which seemed unconscious came out of him then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees amid a stream of blood and saliva the two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth the prisoners sat very still their hands crossed on their knees the chinless man climbed back into his place down one side of his face the flesh was darkening his mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry coloured mass with a black hole in the middle of it from time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls his grey eyes still flitted from face to face more guiltily than ever as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation the door opened with a small gesture the officer indicated the skull faced man room he said there was a gasp and a flurry at winston s side the man had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor with his hand clasped together comrade officer he cried you don t have to take me to that place haven t i told you everything already what else is it you want to know there s nothing i wouldn t confess nothing just tell me what it is and i ll confess straight off write it down and i ll sign it anything not room room said the officer the man s face already very pale turned a colour winston would not have believed possible it was definitely unmistakably a shade of green do anything to me he yelled you ve been starving me for weeks finish it off and let me die shoot me hang me sentence me to twenty five years is there somebody else you want me to give away just say who it is and i ll tell you anything you want i don t care who it is or what you do to them i ve got a wife and three children the biggest of them isn t six years old you can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes and i ll stand by and watch it but not room room said the officer the man looked frantically round at the other prisoners as though with some idea that he could put another victim in his own place his eyes settled on the smashed face of the chinless man he flung out a lean arm that s the one you ought to be taking not me he shouted you didn t hear what he was saying after they bashed his face give me a chance and i ll tell you every word of it he s the one that s against the party not me the guards stepped forward the man s voice rose to a shriek you didn t hear him he repeated something went wrong with the telescreen he s the one you want take him not me the two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms but just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench he had set up a wordless howling like an animal the guards took hold of him to wrench him loose but he clung on with astonishing strength for perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him the prisoners sat quiet their hands crossed on their knees looking straight in front of them the howling stopped the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on then there was a different kind of cry a kick from a guard s boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands they dragged him to his feet room said the officer the man was led out walking unsteadily with head sunken nursing his crushed hand all the fight had gone out of him a long time passed if it had been midnight when the skull faced man was taken away it was morning if morning it was afternoon winston was alone and had been alone for hours the pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about unreproved by the telescreen the piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it at the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it but presently hunger gave way to thirst his mouth was sticky and evil tasting the humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness an empty feeling inside his head he would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned sometimes with a fading hope he thought of o brien and the razor blade it was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food if he were ever fed more dimly he thought of julia somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he she might be screaming with pain at this moment he thought if i could save julia by doubling my own pain would i do it yes i would but that was merely an intellectual decision taken because he knew that he ought to take it he did not feel it in this place you could not feel anything except pain and foreknowledge of pain besides was it possible when you were actually suffering it to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase but that question was not answerable yet the boots were approaching again the door opened o brien came in winston started to his feet the shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him for the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen they ve got you too he cried they got me a long time ago said o brien with a mild almost regretful irony he stepped aside from behind him there emerged a broad chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand you know him winston said o brien don t deceive yourself you did know it you have always known it yes he saw now he had always known it but there was no time to think of that all he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard s hand it might fall anywhere on the crown on the tip of the ear on the upper arm on the elbow the elbow he had slumped to his knees almost paralysed clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand everything had exploded into yellow light inconceivable inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain the light cleared and he
