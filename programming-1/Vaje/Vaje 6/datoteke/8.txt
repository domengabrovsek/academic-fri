could see the other two looking down at him the guard was laughing at his contortions one question at any rate was answered never for any reason on earth could you wish for an increase of pain of pain you could wish only one thing that it should stop nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain in the face of pain there are no heroes no heroes he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm x x x he was lying on something that felt like a camp bed except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face o brien was standing at his side looking down at him intently at the other side of him stood a man in a white coat holding a hypodermic syringe even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually he had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world a sort of underwater world far beneath it how long he had been down there he did not know since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight besides his memories were not continuous there had been times when consciousness even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval but whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds there was no way of knowing with that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected there was a long range of crimes espionage sabotage and the like to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course the confession was a formality though the torture was real how many times he had been beaten how long the beatings had continued he could not remember always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously sometimes it was fists sometimes it was truncheons sometimes it was steel rods sometimes it was boots there were times when he rolled about the floor as shameless as an animal writhing his body this way and that in an endless hopeless effort to dodge the kicks and simply inviting more and yet more kicks in his ribs in his belly on his elbows on his shins in his groin in his testicles on the bone at the base of his spine there were times when it went on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force hirnself into losing consciousness there were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes there were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise when he said to himself i will confess but not yet i must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable three more kicks two more kicks and then i will tell them what they want sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell left to recuperate for a few hours and then taken out and beaten again there were also longer periods of recovery he remembered them dimly because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor he remembered a cell with a plank bed a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall and a tin wash basin and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee he remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair and businesslike unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse tapping his reflexes turning up his eyelids running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep the beatings grew less frequent and became mainly a threat a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory his questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but party intellectuals little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted he thought he could not be sure ten or twelve hours at a stretch these other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on they slapped his face wrung his ears pulled his hair made him stand on one leg refused him leave to urinate shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on hour after hour tripping him up laying traps for him twisting everything that he said convicting him at every step of lies and self contradiction until he beganlittle shops interspersed among dwelling houses immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded he seemed to know the place of course he was standing outside the junk shop where he had bought the diary a twinge of fear went through him it had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning and he had sworn never to come near the place again and yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander his feet had brought him back here of their own accord it was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary at the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty one hours the shop was still open with the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement he stepped through the doorway if questioned he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades the proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp whicphlets embezzlement of public funds sale of military secrets sabotage of every kind he confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as he confessed that he was a religious believer an admirer of capitalism and a sexual pervert he confessed that he had murdered his wife although he knew and his questioners must have known that his wife was still alive he confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known it was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody besides in a sense it was all true it was true that he had been the enemy of the party and in the eyes of the party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed there were also memories of another kind they stood out in his mind disconnectedly like pictures with blackness all round them he was in a cell which might have been either dark or light because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly the eyes grew larger and more luminous suddenly he floated out of his seat dived into the eyes and was swallowed up he was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials under dazzling lights a man in a white coat was reading the dials there was a tramp of heavy boots outside the door clanged open the waxed faced officer marched in followed by two guards room said the officer the man in the white coat did not turn round he did not look at winston either he was looking only at the dials he was rolling down a mighty corridor a kilometre wide full of glorious golden light roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice he was confessing everything even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture he was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already with him were the guards the other questioners the men in white coats o brien julia mr charrington all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened everything was all right there was no more pain the last detail of his life was laid bare understood forgiven he was starting up from the plank bed in the half certainty that he had heard o brien s voice all through his interrogation although he had never seen him he had had the feeling that o brien was at his elbow just out of sight it was o brien who was directing everything it was he who set the guards on to winston and who prevented them from killing him it was he who decided when winston should scream with pain when he should have a respite when he should be fed when he should sleep when the drugs should be pumped into his arm it was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers he was the tormentor he was the protector he was the inquisitor he was the friend and once winston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep or in normal sleep or even in a moment of wakefulness a voice murmured in his ear don t worry winston you are in my keeping for seven years i have watched over you now the turning point has come i shall save you i shall make you perfect he was not sure whether it was o brien s voice but it was the same voice that had said to him we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness in that other dream seven years ago he did not remember any ending to his interrogation there was a period of blackness and then the cell or room in which he now was had gradually materialized round him he was almost flat on his back and unable to move his body was held down at every essential point even the back of his head was gripped in some manner o brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly his face seen from below looked coarse and worn with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin he was older than winston had thought him he was perhaps forty eight or fifty under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face i told you said o brien that if we met again it would be here yes said winston without any warning except a slight movement of o brien s hand a wave of pain flooded his body it was a frightening pain because he could not see what was happening and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him he did not know whether the thing was really happening or whether the effect was electrically produced but his body was being wrenched out of shape the joints were being slowly torn apart although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about to snap he set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose trying to keep silent as long as possible you are afraid said o brien watching his face that in another moment something is going to break your especial fear is that it will be your backbone you have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them that is what you are thinking is it not winston winston did not answer o brien drew back the lever on the dial the wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come that was forty said o brien you can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred will you please remember throughout our conversation that i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree i choose if you tell me any lies or attempt to prevaricate in any way or even fall below your usual level of intelligence you will cry out with pain instantly do you understand that yes said winston o brien s manner became less severe he resettled his spectacles thoughtfully and took a pace or two up and down when he spoke his voice was gentle and patient he had the air of a doctor a teacher even a priest anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish i am taking trouble with you winston he said because you are worth trouble you know perfectly well what is the matter with you you have known it for years though you have fought against the knowledge you are mentally deranged you suffer from a defective memory you are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened fortunately it is curable you have never cured yourself of it because you did not choose to there was a small effort of the will that you were not ready to make even now i am well aware you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue now we will take an example at this moment which power is oceania at war with when i was arrested oceania was at war with eastasia with eastasia good and oceania has always been at war with eastasia has it not winston drew in his breath he opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak he could not take his eyes away from the dial the truth please winston your truth tell me what you think you remember i remember that until only a week before i was arrested we were not at war with eastasia at all we were in alliance with them the war was against eurasia that had lasted for four years before that o brien stopped him with a movement of the hand another example he said some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed you believed that three men three onetime party members named jones aaronson and rutherford men who were executed for treachery and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with you believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false there was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination you believed that you had actually held it in your hands it was a photograph something like this an oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between o brien s fingers for perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of winston s vision it was a photograph and there was no question of its identity it was the photograph it was another copy of the photograph of jones aaronson and rutherford at the party function in new york which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed for only an instant it was before his eyes then it was out of sight again but he had seen it unquestionably he had seen it he made a desperate agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free it was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction for the moment he had even forgotten the dial all he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again or at least to see it it exists he cried no said o brien he stepped across the room there was a memory hole in the opposite wall o brien lifted the grating unseen the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air it was vanishing in a flash of flame o brien turned away from the wall ashes he said not even identifiable ashes dust it does not exist it never existed but it did exist it does exist it exists in memory i remember it you remember it i do not remember it said o brien winston s heart sank that was doublethink he had a feeling of deadly helplessness if he could have been certain that o brien was lying it would not have seemed to matter but it was perfectly possible that o brien had really forgotten the photograph and if so then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it and forgotten the act of forgetting how could one be sure that it was simple trickery perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen that was the thought that defeated him o brien was looking down at him speculatively more than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child there is a party slogan dealing with the control of the past he said repeat it if you please who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past repeated winston obediently who controls the present controls the past said o brien nodding his head with slow approval is it your opinion winston that the past has real existence again the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston his eyes flitted towards the dial he not only did not know whether yes or no was the answer that would save him from pain he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one o brien smiled faintly you are no metaphysician winston he said until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence i will put it more precisely does the past exist concretely in space is there somewhere or other a place a world of solid objects where the past is still happening no then where does the past exist if at all in records it is written down in records and in the mind in human memories in memory very well then we the party control all records and we control all memories then we control the past do we not but how can you stop people remembering things cried winston again momentarily forgetting the dial it is involuntary it is outside oneself how can you control memory you have not controlled mine o brien s manner grew stern again he laid his hand on the dial on the contrary he said you have not controlled it that is what has brought you here you are here because you have failed in humility in self discipline you would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity you preferred to be a lunatic a minority of one only the disciplined mind can see reality winston you believe that reality is something objective external existing in its own right you also believe that the nature of reality is self evident when you delude yourself into thinking that you see something you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you but i tell you winston that reality is not external reality exists in the human mind and nowhere else not in the individual mind which can make mistakes and in any case soon perishes only in the mind of the party which is collective and immortal whatever the party holds to be the truth is truth it is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the party that is the fact that you have got to relearn winston it needs an act of self destruction an effort of the will you must humble yourself before you can become sane he paused for a few moments as though to allow what he had been saying to sink in do you remember he went on writing in your diary freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four yes said winston o brien held up his left hand its back towards winston with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended how many fingers am i holding up winston four and if the party says that it is not four but five then how many four the word ended in a gasp of pain the needle of the dial had shot up to fifty five the sweat had sprung out all over winston s body the air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop o brien watched him the four fingers still extended he drew back the lever this time the pain was only slightly eased how many fingers winston four the needle went up to sixty how many fingers winston four four what else can i say four the needle must have risen again but he did not look at it the heavy stern face and the four fingers filled his vision the fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars enormous blurry and seeming to vibrate but unmistakably four how many fingers winston four stop it stop it how can you go on four four how many fingers winston five five five no winston that is no use you are lying you still think there are four how many fingers please four five four anything you like only stop it stop the pain abruptly he was sitting up with o brien s arm round his shoulders he had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds the bonds that had held his body down were loosened he felt very cold he was shaking uncontrollably his teeth were chattering the tears were rolling down his cheeks for a moment he clung to o brien like a baby curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders he had the feeling that o brien was his protector that the pain was something that came from outside from some other source and that it was o brien who would save him from it you are a slow learner winston said o brien gently how can i help it he blubbered how can i help seeing what is in front of my eyes two and two are four sometimes winston sometimes they are five sometimes they are three sometimes they are all of them at once you must try harder it is not easy to become sane he laid winston down on the bed the grip of his limbs tightened again but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped leaving him merely weak and cold o brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings the man in the white coat bent down and looked closely into winston s eyes felt his pulse laid an ear against his chest tapped here and there then he nodded to o brien again said o brien the pain flowed into winston s body the needle must be at seventy seventy five he had shut his eyes this time he knew that the fingers were still there and still four all that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over he had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not the pain lessened again he opened his eyes o brien had drawn back the lever how many fingers winston four i suppose there are four i would see five if i could i am trying to see five which do you wish to persuade me that you see five or really to see them really to see them again said o brien perhaps the needle was eighty ninety winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening behind his screwed up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance weaving in and out disappearing behind one another and reappearing again he was trying to count them he could not remember why he knew only that it was impossible to count them and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four the pain died down again when he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing innumerable fingers like moving trees were still streaming past in either direction crossing and recrossing he shut his eyes again how many fingers am i holding up winston i don t know i don t know you will kill me if you do that again four five six in all honesty i don t know better said o brien a needle slid into winston s arm almost in the same instant a blissful healing warmth spread all through his body the pain was already half forgotten he opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at o brien at sight of the heavy lined face so ugly and so intelligent his heart seemed to turn over if he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on o brien arm he had never loved him so deeply as at this moment and not merely because he had stopped the pain the old feeling that it bottom it did not matter whether o brien was a friend or an enemy had come back o brien was a person who could be talked to perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood o brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy and in a little while it was certain he would send him to his death it made no difference in some sense that went deeper than friendship they were intimates somewhere or other although the actual words might never be spoken there was a place where they could meet and talk o brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind when he spoke it was in an easy conversational tone do you know where you are winston he said i don t know i can guess in the ministry of love do you know how long you have been here i don t know days weeks months i think it is months and why do you imagine that we bring people to this place to make them confess no that is not the reason try again to punish them no exclaimed o brien his voice had changed extraordinarily and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated no not merely to extract your confession not to punish you shall i tell you why we have brought you here to cure you to make you sane will you understand winston that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured we are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed the party is not interested in the overt act the thought is all we care about we do not merely destroy our enemies we change them do you understand what i mean by that he was bending over winston his face looked enormous because of its nearness and hideously ugly because it was seen from below moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity again winston s heart shrank if it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed he felt certain that o brien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness at this moment however o brien turned away he took a pace or two up and down then he continued less vehemently the first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms you have read of the religious persecutions of the past in the middle ages there was the inquisitlon it was a failure it set out to eradicate heresy and ended by perpetuating it for every heretic it burned at the stake thousands of others rose up why was that because the inquisition killed its enemies in the open and killed them while they were still unrepentant in fact it killed them because they were unrepentant men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burned him later in the twentieth century there were the totalitarians as they were called there were the german nazis and the russian communists the russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the inquisition had done and they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past they knew at any rate that one must not make martyrs before they exposed their victims to public trial they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity they wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable cringing wretches confessing whatever was put into their mouths covering themselves with abuse accusing and sheltering behind one another whimpering for mercy and yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again the dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten once again why was it in the first place because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue we do not make mistakes of that kind all the confessions that are uttered here are true we make them true and above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us you must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you winston posterity will never hear of you you will be lifted clean out from the stream of history we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere nothing will remain of you not a name in a register not a memory in a living brain you will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future you will never have existed then why bother to torture me thought winston with a momentary bitterness o brien checked his step as though winston had uttered the thought aloud his large ugly face came nearer with the eyes a little narrowed you are thinking he said that since we intend to destroy you utterly so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference in that case why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first that is what you were thinking was it not yes said winston o brien smiled slightly you are a flaw in the pattern winston you are a stain that must be wiped out did i not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past we are not content with negative obedience nor even with the most abject submission when finally you surrender to us it must be of your own free will we do not destroy the heretic because he resists us so long as he resists us we never destroy him we convert him we capture his inner mind we reshape him we burn all evil and all illusion out of him we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul we make him one of ourselves before we kill him it is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerless it may be even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation in the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic proclaiming his heresy exulting in it even the victim of the russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet but we make the brain perfect before we blow it out the command of the old despotisms was thou shalt not the command of the totalitarians was thou shalt our command is thou art no one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us everyone is washed clean even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed jones aaronson and rutherford in the end we broke them down i took part in their interrogation myself i saw them gradually worn down whimpering grovelling weeping and in the end it was not with pain or fear only with penitence by the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men there was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done and love of big brother it was touching to see how they loved him they begged to be shot quickly so that they could die while their minds were still clean his voice had grown almost dreamy the exaltation the lunatic enthusiasm was still in his face he is not pretending thought winston he is not a hypocrite he believes every word he says what most oppressed him was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority he watched the heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro in and out of the range of his vision o brien was a being in all ways larger than himself there was no idea that he had ever had or could have that o brien had not long ago known examined and rejected his mind contained winston s mind but in that case how could it be true that o brien was mad it must be he winston who was mad o brien halted and looked down at him his voice had grown stern again do not imagine that you will save yourself winston however completely you surrender to us no one who has once gone astray is ever spared and even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life still you would never escape from us what happens to you here is for ever understand that in advance we shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back things will happen to you from which you could not recover if you lived a thousand years never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling everything will be dead inside you never again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity you will be hollow we shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves he paused and signed to the man in the white coat winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head o brien had sat down beside the bed so that his face was almost on a level with winston s three thousand he said speaking over winston s head to the man in the white coat two soft pads which felt slightly moist clamped themselves against winston s temples he quailed there was pain coming a new kind of pain o brien laid a hand reassuringly almost kindly on his this time it will not hurt he said keep your eyes fixed on mine at this moment there was a devastating explosion or what seemed like an explosion though it was not certain whether there was any noise there was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light winston was not hurt only prostrated although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position a terrific painless blow had flattened him out also something had happened inside his head as his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was and where he was and recognized the face that was gazing into his own but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness as though a piece had been taken out of his brain it will not last said o brien look me in the eyes what country is oceania at war with winston thought he knew what was meant by oceania and that he himself was a citizen of oceania he also remembered eurasia and eastasia but who was at war with whom he did not know in fact he had not been aware that there was any war i don t remember oceania is at war with eastasia do you remember that now yes oceania has always been at war with eastasia since the beginning of your life since the beginning of the party since the beginning of history the war has continued without a break always the same war do you remember that yes eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery you pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent no such piece of paper ever existed you invented it and later you grew to believe in it you remember now the very moment at which you first invented it do you remember that yes just now i held up the fingers of my hand to you you saw five fingers do you remember that yes o brien held up the fingers of his left hand with the thumb concealed there are five fingers there do you see five fingers yes and he did see them for a fleeting instant before the scenery of his mind changed he saw five fingers and there was no deformity then everything was normal again and the old fear the hatred and the bewilderment came crowding back again but there had been a moment he did not know how long thirty seconds perhaps of luminous certainty when each new suggestion of o brien s had filled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth and when two and two could have been three as easily as five if that were what was needed it had faded but before o brien had dropped his hand but though he could not recapture it he could remember it as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of one s life when one was in effect a different person you see now said o brien that it is at any rate possible yes said winston o brien stood up with a satisfied air over to his left winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe o brien turned to winston with a smile in almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles on his nose do you remember writing in your diary he said that it did not matter whether i was a friend or an enemy since i was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to you were right i enjoy talking to you your mind appeals to me it resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions if you choose any question i like anything he saw that winston s eyes were upon the dial it is switched off what is your first question what have you done with julia said winston o brien smiled again she betrayed you winston immediately unreservedly i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly you would hardly recognize her if you saw her all her rebelliousness her deceit her folly her dirty mindedness everything has been burned out of her it was a perfect conversion a textbook case you tortured her o brien left this unanswered next question he said does big brother exist of course he exists the party exists big brother is the embodiment of the party does he exist in the same way as i exist you do not exist said o brien once again the sense of helplessness assailed him he knew or he could imagine the arguments which proved his own nonexistence but they were nonsense they were only a play on words did not the statement you do not exist contain a logical absurdity but what use was it to say so his mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable mad arguments with which o brien would demolish him i think i exist he said wearily i am conscious of my own identity i was born and i shall die i have arms and legs i occupy a particular point in space no other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously in that sense does big brother exist it is of no importance he exists will big brother ever die of course not how could he die next question does the brotherhood exist that winston you will never know if we choose to set you free when we have finished with you and if you live to be ninety years old still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no as long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind winston lay silent his breast rose and fell a little faster he still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first he had got to ask it and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it there was a trace of amusement in o brien s face even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam he knows thought winston suddenly he knows what i am going to ask at the thought the words burst out of him what is in room the expression on o brien s face did not change he answered drily you know what is in room winston everyone knows what is in room he raised a finger to the man in the white coat evidently the session was at an end a needle jerked into winston s arm he sank almost instantly into deep sleep x x x there are three stages in your reintegration said o brien there is learning there is understanding and there is acceptance it is time for you to enter upon the second stage as always winston was lying flat on his back but of late his bonds were looser they still held him to the bed but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow the dial also had grown to be less of a terror he could evade its pangs if he was quick witted enough it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that o brien pulled the lever sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial he could not remember how many sessions there had been the whole process seemed to stretch out over a long indefinite time weeks possibly and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days sometimes only an hour or two as you lie there said o brien you have often wondered you have even asked me why the ministry of love should expend so much time and trouble on you and when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question you could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived in but not its underlying motives do you remember writing in your diary i understand how i do not understand why it was when you thought about why that you doubted your own sanity you have read the book goldstein s book or parts of it at least did it tell you anything that you did not know already you have read it said winston i wrote it that is to say i collaborated in writing it no book is produced individually as you know is it true what it says a description yes the programme it sets forth is nonsense the secret accumulation of knowledge a gradual spread of enlightenment ultimately a proletarian rebellion the overthrow of the party you foresaw yourself that that was what it would say it is all nonsense the proletarians will never revolt not in a thousand years or a million they cannot i do not have to tell you the reason you know it already if you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection you must abandon them there is no way in which the party can be overthrown the rule of the party is for ever make that the starting point of your thoughts he came closer to the bed for ever he repeated and now let us get back to the question of how and why you understand well enough how the party maintains itself in power now tell me why we cling to power what is our motive why should we want power go on speak he added as winston remained silent nevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two a feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him the faint mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into o brien s face he knew in advance what o brien would say that the party did not seek power for its own ends but only for the good of the majority that it sought power because men in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves that the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness was better that the party was the eternal guardian of the weak a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come sacrificing its own happiness to that of others the terrible thing thought winston the terrible thing was that when o brien said this he would believe it you could see it in his face o brien knew everything a thousand times better than winston he knew what the world was really like in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the party kept them there he had understood it all weighed it all and it made no difference all was justified by the ultimate purpose what can you do thought winston against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy you are ruling over us for our own good he said feebly you believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves and therefore he started and almost cried out a pang of pain had shot through his body o brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty five that was stupid winston stupid he said you should know better than to say a thing like that he pulled the lever back and continued now i will tell you the answer to my question it is this the party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness only power pure power what pure power means you will understand presently we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing all the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives they pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal we are not like that we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it power is not a means it is an end one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship the object of persecution is persecution the object of torture is torture the object of power is power now do you begin to understand me winston was struck as he had been struck before by the tiredness of o brien s face it was strong and fleshy and brutal it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless but it was tired there were pouches under the eyes the skin sagged from the cheekbones o brien leaned over him deliberately bringing the worn face nearer you are thinking he said that my face is old and tired you are thinking that i talk of power and yet i am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body can you not understand winston that the individual is only a cell the weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism do you die when you cut your fingernails he turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again one hand in his pocket we are the priests of power he said god is power but at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned it is time for you to gather some idea of what power means the first thing you must realize is that power is collective the individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual you know the party slogan freedom is slavery has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible slavery is freedom alone free the human being is always defeated it must be so because every human being is doomed to die which is the greatest of all failures but if he can make complete utter submission if he can escape from his identity if he can merge himself in the party so that he is the party then he is all powerful and immortal the second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings over the body but above all over the mind power over matter external reality as you would call it is not important already our control over matter is absolute for a moment winston ignored the dial he made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully but how can you control matter he burst out you don t even control the climate or the law of gravity and there are disease pain death o brien silenced him by a movement of his hand we control matter because we control the mind reality is inside the skull you will learn by degrees winston there is nothing that we could not do invisibility levitation anything i could float off this floor like a soap bubble if i wish to i do not wish to because the party does not wish it you must get rid of those nineteenth century ideas about the laws of nature we make the laws of nature but you do not you are not even masters of this planet what about eurasia and eastasia you have not conquered them yet unimportant we shall conquer them when it suits us and if we did not what difference would it make we can shut them out of existence oceania is the world but the world itself is only a speck of dust and man is tiny helpless how long has he been in existence for millions of years the earth was uninhabited nonsense the earth is as old as we are no older how could it be older nothing exists except through human consciousness but the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of have you ever seen those bones winston of course not nineteenth century biologists invented them before man there was nothing after man if he could come to an end there would be nothing outside man there is nothing but the whole universe is outside us look at the stars some of them are a million light years away they are out of our reach for ever what are the stars said o brien indifferently they are bits of fire a few kilometres away we could reach them if we wanted to or we could blot them out the earth is the centre of the universe the sun and the stars go round it winston made another convulsive movement this time he did not say anything o brien continued as though answering a spoken objection for certain purposes of course that is not true when we navigate the ocean or when we predict an eclipse we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away but what of it do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy the stars can be near or distant according as we need them do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that have you forgotten doublethink winston shrank back upon the bed whatever he said the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon and yet he knew he knew that he was in the right the belief that nothing exists outside your own mind surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy there was even a name for it which he had forgotten a faint smile twitched the corners of o brien s mouth as he looked down at him i told you winston he said that metaphysics is not your strong point the word you are trying to think of is solipsism but you are mistaken this is not solipsism collective solipsism if you like but that is a different thing in fact the opposite thing all this is a digression he added in a different tone the real power the power we have to fight for night and day is not power over things but over men he paused and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil how does one man assert his power over another winston winston thought by making him suffer he said exactly by making him suffer obedience is not enough unless he is suffering how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own power is in inflicting pain and humiliation power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined a world of fear and treachery is torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world will be progress towards more pain the old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice ours is founded upon hatred in our world there will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and self abasement everything else we shall destroy everything already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer but in the future there will be no wives and no friends children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen the sex instinct will be eradicated procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card we shall abolish the orgasm our neurologists are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love of big brother there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy there will be no art no literature no science when we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life all competing pleasures will be destroyed but always do not forget this winston always there will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face for ever he paused as though he expected winston to speak winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again he could not say anything his heart seemed to be frozen o brien went on and remember that it is for ever the face will always be there to be stamped upon the heretic the enemy of society will always be there so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands all that will continue and worse the espionage the betrayals the arrests the tortures the executions the disappearances will never cease it will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph the more the party is powerful the less it will be tolerant the weaker the opposition the tighter the despotism goldstein and his heresies will live for ever every day at every moment they will be defeated discredited ridiculed spat upon and yet they will always survive this drama that i have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation always in subtler forms always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy screaming with pain broken up contemptible and in the end utterly penitent saved from himself crawling to our feet of his own accord that is the world that we are preparing winston a world of victory after victory triumph after triumph after triumph an endless pressing pressing pressing upon the nerve of power you are beginning i can see to realize what that world will be like but in the end you will do more than understand it you will accept it welcome it become part of it winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak you can t he said weakly what do you mean by that remark winston you could not create such a world as you have just described it is a dream it is impossible why it is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty it would never endure why not it would have no
