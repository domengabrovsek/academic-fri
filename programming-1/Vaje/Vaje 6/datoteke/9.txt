vitality it would disintegrate it would commit suicide nonsense you are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love why should it be and if it were what difference would that make suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty still what difference would it make can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death the party is immortal as usual the voice had battered winston into helplessness moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement o brien would twist the dial again and yet he could not keep silent feebly without arguments with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what o brien had said he returned to the attack i don t know i don t care somehow you will fail something will defeat you life will defeat you we control life winston at all its levels you are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us but we create human nature men are infinitely malleable or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us put it out of your mind they are helpless like the animals humanity is the party the others are outside irrelevant i don t care in the end they will beat you sooner or later they will see you for what you are and then they will tear you to pieces do you see any evidence that that is happening or any reason why it should no i believe it i know that you will fail there is something in the universe i don t know some spirit some principle that you will never overcome do you believe in god winston no then what is it this principle that will defeat us i don t know the spirit of man and do you consider yourself a man yes if you are a man winston you are the last man your kind is extinct we are the inheritors do you understand that you are alone you are outside history you are non existent his manner changed and he said more harshly and you consider yourself morally superior to us with our lies and our cruelty yes i consider myself superior o brien did not speak two other voices were speaking after a moment winston recognized one of them as his own it was a sound track of the conversation he had had with o brien on the night when he had enrolled himself in the brotherhood he heard himself promising to lie to steal to forge to murder to encourage drug taking and prostitution to disseminate venereal diseases to throw vitriol in a child s face o brien made a small impatient gesture as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making then he turned a switch and the voices stopped get up from that bed he said the bonds had loosened themselves winston lowered himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily you are the last man said o brien you are the guardian of the human spirit you shall see yourself as you are take off your clothes winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together the zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of them he could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes as he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three sided mirror at the far end of the room he approached it then stopped short an involuntary cry had broken out of him go on said o brien stand between the wings of the mirror you shall see the side view as well he had stopped because he was frightened a bowed greycoloured skeleton like thing was coming towards him its actual appearance was frightening and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself he moved closer to the glass the creature s face seemed to be protruded because of its bent carriage a forlorn jailbird s face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp a crooked nose and battered looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful the cheeks were seamed the mouth had a drawn in look certainly it was his own face but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside the emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt he had gone partially bald for the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well but it was only the scalp that was grey except for his hands and a circle of his face his body was grey all over with ancient ingrained dirt here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it but the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body the barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs he saw now what o brien had meant about seeing the side view the curvature of the spine was astonishing the thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull at a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty suffering from some malignant disease you have thought sometimes said o brien that my face the face of a member of the inner party looks old and worn what do you think of your own face he seized winston s shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him look at the condition you are in he said look at this filthy grime all over your body look at the dirt between your toes look at that disgusting running sore on your leg do you know that you stink like a goat probably you have ceased to notice it look at your emaciation do you see i can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep i could snap your neck like a carrot do you know that you have lost twenty five kilograms since you have been in our hands even your hair is coming out in handfuls look he plucked at winston s head and brought away a tuft of hair open your mouth nine ten eleven teeth left how many had you when you came to us and the few you have left are dropping out of your head look here he seized one of winston s remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger a twinge of pain shot through winston s jaw o brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots he tossed it across the cell you are rotting away he said you are falling to pieces what are you a bag of filth now turn around and look into that mirror again do you see that thing facing you that is the last man if you are human that is humanity now put your clothes on again winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was only one thought stirred in his mind that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears he was aware of his ugliness his gracelessness a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light but he could not stop himself o brien laid a hand on his shoulder almost kindly it will not last for ever he said you can escape from it whenever you choose everything depends on yourself you did it sobbed winston you reduced me to this state no winston you reduced yourself to it this is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the party it was all contained in that first act nothing has happened that you did not foresee he paused and then went on we have beaten you winston we have broken you up you have seen what your body is like your mind is in the same state i do not think there can be much pride left in you you have been kicked and flogged and insulted you have screamed with pain you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit you have whimpered for mercy you have betrayed everybody and everything can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you winston had stopped weeping though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes he looked up at o brien i have not betrayed julia he said o brien looked down at him thoughtfully no he said no that is perfectly true you have not betrayed julia the peculiar reverence for o brien which nothing seemed able to destroy flooded winston s heart again how intelligent he thought how intelligent never did o brien fail to understand what was said to him anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed julia for what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture he had told them everything he knew about her her habits her character her past life he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings all that he had said to her and she to him their black market meals their adulteries their vague plottings against the party everything and yet in the sense in which he intended the word he had not betrayed her he had not stopped loving her his feelings towards her had remained the same o brien had seen what he meant without the need for explanation tell me he said how soon will they shoot me it might be a long time said o brien you are a difficult case but don t give up hope everyone is cured sooner or later in the end we shall shoot you x x x he was much better he was growing fatter and stronger every day if it was proper to speak of days the white light and the humming sound were the same as ever but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in there was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed and a stool to sit on they had given him a bath and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin they even gave him warm water to wash with they had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls they had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment they had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures weeks or months must have passed it would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time if he had felt any interest in doing so since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals he was getting he judged three meals in the twenty four hours sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day the food was surprisingly good with meat at every third meal once there was even a packet of cigarettes he had no matches but the never speaking guard who brought his food would give him a light the first time he tried to smoke it made him sick but he persevered and spun the packet out for a long time smoking half a cigarette after each meal they had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner at first he made no use of it even when he was awake he was completely torpid often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring sometimes asleep sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes he had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face it seemed to make no difference except that one s dreams were more coherent he dreamed a great deal all through this time and they were always happy dreams he was in the golden country or he was sitting among enormous glorious sunlit ruins with his mother with julia with o brien not doing anything merely sitting in the sun talking of peaceful things such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams he seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort now that the stimulus of pain had been removed he was not bored he had no desire for conversation or distraction merely to be alone not to be beaten or questioned to have enough to eat and to be clean all over was completely satisfying by degrees he came to spend less time in sleep but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed all he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body he would finger himself here and there trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees after that reluctantly at first he began exercising himself regularly in a little while he could walk three kilometres measured by pacing the cell and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter he attempted more elaborate exercises and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do he could not move out of a walk he could not hold his stool out at arm s length he could not stand on one leg without falling over he squatted down on his heels and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position he lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands it was hopeless he could not raise himself a centimetre but after a few more days a few more mealtimes even that feat was accomplished a time came when he could do it six times running he began to grow actually proud of his body and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror his mind grew more active he sat down on the plank bed his back against the wall and the slate on his knees and set to work deliberately at the task of re educating himself he had capitulated that was agreed in reality as he saw now he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision from the moment when he was inside the ministry of love and yes even during those minutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do he had grasped the frivolity the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the party he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying glass there was no physical act no word spoken aloud that they had not noticed no train of thought that they had not been able to infer even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced they had played sound tracks to him shown him photographs some of them were photographs of julia and himself yes even he could not fight against the party any longer besides the party was in the right it must be so how could the immortal collective brain be mistaken by what external standard could you check its judgements sanity was statistical it was merely a question of learning to think as they thought only the pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers he began to write down the thoughts that came into his head he wrote first in large clumsy capitals freedom is slavery then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it two and two make five but then there came a sort of check his mind as though shying away from something seemed unable to concentrate he knew that he knew what came next but for the moment he could not recall it when he did recall it it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be it did not come of its own accord he wrote god is power he accepted everything the past was alterable the past never had been altered oceania was at war with eastasia oceania had always been at war with eastasia jones aaronson and rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with he had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt it had never existed he had invented it he remembered remembering contrary things but those were false memories products of selfdeception how easy it all was only surrender and everything else followed it was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it nothing had changed except your own attitude the predestined thing happened in any case he hardly knew why he had ever rebelled everything was easy except anything could be true the so called laws of nature were nonsense the law of gravity was nonsense if i wished o brien had said i could float off this floor like a soap bubble winston worked it out if he thinks he floats off the floor and if i simultaneously think i see him do it then the thing happens suddenly like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water the thought burst into his mind it doesn t really happen we imagine it it is hallucination he pushed the thought under instantly the fallacy was obvious it presupposed that somewhere or other outside oneself there was a real world where real things happened but how could there be such a world what knowledge have we of anything save through our own minds all happenings are in the mind whatever happens in all minds truly happens he had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy and he was in no danger of succumbing to it he realized nevertheless that it ought never to have occurred to him the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimestop they called it in newspeak he set to work to exercise himself in crimestop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ice is heavier than water and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them it was not easy it needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation the arithmetical problems raised for instance by such a statement as two and two make five were beyond his intellectual grasp it needed also a sort of athleticism of mind an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors stupidity was as necessary as intelligence and as difficult to attain all the while with one part of his mind he wondered how soon they would shoot him everything depends on yourself o brien had said but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer it might be ten minutes hence or ten years they might keep him for years in solitary confinement they might send him to a labour camp they might release him for a while as they sometimes did it was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again the one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment the tradition the unspoken tradition somehow you knew it though you never heard it said was that they shot you from behind always in the back of the head without warning as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell one day but one day was not the right expression just as probably it was in the middle of the night once he fell into a strange blissful reverie he was walking down the corridor waiting for the bullet he knew that it was coming in another moment everything was settled smoothed out reconciled there were no more doubts no more arguments no more pain no more fear his body was healthy and strong he walked easily with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight he was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the ministry of love he was in the enormous sunlit passage a kilometre wide down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs he was in the golden country following the foot track across the old rabbit cropped pasture he could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face at the edge of the field were the elm trees faintly stirring and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows suddenly he started up with a shock of horror the sweat broke out on his backbone he had heard himself cry aloud julia julia julia my love julia for a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence she had seemed to be not merely with him but inside him it was as though she had got into the texture of his skin in that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help he lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself what had he done how many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness in another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside they could not let such an outburst go unpunished they would know now if they had not known before that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them he obeyed the party but he still hated the party in the old days he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity now he had retreated a step further in the mind he had surrendered but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate he knew that he was in the wrong but he preferred to be in the wrong they would understand that o brien would understand it it was all confessed in that single foolish cry he would have to start all over again it might take years he ran a hand over his face trying to familiarize himself with the new shape there were deep furrows in the cheeks the cheekbones felt sharp the nose flattened besides since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth it was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like in any case mere control of the features was not enough for the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself you must know all the while that it is there but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name from now onwards he must not only think right he must feel right dream right and all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him a kind of cyst one day they would decide to shoot him you could not tell when it would happen but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess it was always from behind walking down a corridor ten seconds would be enough in that time the world inside him could turn over and then suddenly without a word uttered without a check in his step without the changing of a line in his face suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang would go the batteries of his hatred hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame and almost in the same instant bang would go the bullet too late or too early they would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it the heretical thought would be unpunished unrepented out of their reach for ever they would have blown a hole in their own perfection to die hating them that was freedom he shut his eyes it was more difficult than accepting an intellectual discipline it was a question of degrading himself mutilating himself he had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth what was the most horrible sickening thing of all he thought of big brother the enormous face because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro seemed to float into his mind of its own accord what were his true feelings towards big brother there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage the steel door swung open with a clang o brien walked into the cell behind him were the waxen faced officer and the black uniformed guards get up said o brien come here winston stood opposite him o brien took winston s shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely you have had thoughts of deceiving me he said that was stupid stand up straighter look me in the face he paused and went on in a gentler tone you are improving intellectually there is very little wrong with you it is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress tell me winston and remember no lies you know that i am always able to detect a lie tell me what are your true feelings towards big brother i hate him you hate him good then the time has come for you to take the last step you must love big brother it is not enough to obey him you must love him he released winston with a little push towards the guards room he said x x x at each stage of his imprisonment he had known or seemed to know whereabouts he was in the windowless building possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure the cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level the room where he had been interrogated by o brien was high up near the roof this place was many metres underground as deep down as it was possible to go it was bigger than most of the cells he had been in but he hardly noticed his surroundings all he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him each covered with green baize one was only a metre or two from him the other was further away near the door he was strapped upright in a chair so tightly that he could move nothing not even his head a sort of pad gripped his head from behind forcing him to look straight in front of him for a moment he was alone then the door opened and o brien came in you asked me once said o brien what was in room i told you that you knew the answer already everyone knows it the thing that is in room is the worst thing in the world the door opened again a guard came in carrying something made of wire a box or basket of some kind he set it down on the further table because of the position in which o brien was standing winston could not see what the thing was the worst thing in the world said o brien varies from individual to individual it may be burial alive or death by fire or by drowning or by impalement or fifty other deaths there are cases where it is some quite trivial thing not even fatal he had moved a little to one side so that winston had a better view of the thing on the table it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask with the concave side outwards although it was three or four metres away from him he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compart ments and that there was some kind of creature in each they were rats in your case said o brien the worst thing in the world happens to be rats a sort of premonitory tremor a fear of he was not certain what had passed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage but at this moment the meaning of the mask like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him his bowels seemed to turn to water you can t do that he cried out in a high cracked voice you couldn t you couldn t it s impossible do you remember said o brien the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams there was a wall of blackness in front of you and a roaring sound in your ears there was something terrible on the other side of the wall you knew that you knew what it was but you dared not drag it into the open it was the rats that were on the other side of the wall o brien said winston making an effort to control his voice you know this is not necessary what is it that you want me to do o brien made no direct answer when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected he looked thoughtfully into the distance as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind winston s back by itself he said pain is not always enough there are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain even to the point of death but for everyone there is something unendurable something that cannot be contemplated courage and cowardice are not involved if you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope if you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air it is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed it is the same with the rats for you they are unendurable they are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand even if you wished to you will do what is required of you but what is it what is it how can i do it if i don t know what it is o brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table he set it down carefully on the baize cloth winston could hear the blood singing in his ears he had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness he was in the middle of a great empty plain a flat desert drenched with sunlight across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him they were enormous rats they were at the age when a rat s muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey the rat said o brien still addressing his invisible audience although a rodent is carnivorous you are aware of that you will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town in some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house even for five minutes the rats are certain to attack it within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones they also attack sick or dying people they show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless there was an outburst of squeals from the cage it seemed to reach winston from far away the rats were fighting they were trying to get at each other through the partition he heard also a deep groan of despair that too seemed to come from outside himself o brien picked up the cage and as he did so pressed something in it there was a sharp click winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair it was hopeless every part of him even his head was held immovably o brien moved the cage nearer it was less than a metre from winston s face i have pressed the first lever said o brien you understand the construction of this cage the mask will fit over your head leaving no exit when i press this other lever the door of the cage will slide up these starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets have you ever seen a rat leap through the air they will leap on to your face and bore straight into it sometimes they attack the eyes first sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue the cage was nearer it was closing in winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head but he fought furiously against his panic to think to think even with a split second left to think was the only hope suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils there was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him and he almost lost consciousness everything had gone black for an instant he was insane a screaming animal yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea there was one and only one way to save himself he must interpose another human being the body of another human being between himself and the rats the circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else the wire door was a couple of hand spans from his face the rats knew what was coming now one of them was leaping up and down the other an old scaly grandfather of the sewers stood up with his pink hands against the bars and fiercely sniffed the air winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth again the black panic took hold of him he was blind helpless mindless it was a common punishment in imperial china said o brien as didactically as ever the mask was closing on his face the wire brushed his cheek and then no it was not relief only hope a tiny fragment of hope too late perhaps too late but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment one body that he could thrust between himself and the rats and he was shouting frantically over and over do it to julia do it to julia not me julia i don t care what you do to her tear her face off strip her to the bones not me julia not me he was falling backwards into enormous depths away from the rats he was still strapped in the chair but he had fallen through the floor through the walls of the building through the earth through the oceans through the atmosphere into outer space into the gulfs between the stars always away away away from the rats he was light years distant but o brien was still standing at his side there was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek but through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open x x x the chestnut tree was almost empty a ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell on dusty table tops it was the lonely hour of fifteen a tinny music trickled from the telescreens winston sat in his usual corner gazing into an empty glass now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall big brother is watching you the caption said unbidden a waiter came and filled his glass up with victory gin shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork it was saccharine flavoured with cloves the speciality of the cafe winston was listening to the telescreen at present only music was coming out of it but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the ministry of peace the news from the african front was disquieting in the extreme on and off he had been worrying about it all day a eurasian army oceania was at war with eurasia oceania had always been at war with eurasia was moving southward at terrifying speed the mid day bulletin had not mentioned any definite area but it was probable that already the mouth of the congo was a battlefield brazzaville and leopoldville were in danger one did not have to look at the map to see what it meant it was not merely a question of losing central africa for the first time in the whole war the territory of oceania itself was menaced a violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement flared up in him then faded again he stopped thinking about the war in these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time he picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp as always the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly the stuff was horrible the cloves and saccharine themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way could not disguise the flat oily smell and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin which dwelt with him night and day was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those he never named them even in his thoughts and so far as it was possible he never visualized them they were something that he was half aware of hovering close to his face a smell that clung to his nostrils as the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips he had grown fatter since they released him and had regained his old colour indeed more than regained it his features had thickened the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red even the bald scalp was too deep a pink a waiter again unbidden brought the chessboard and the current issue of the times with the page turned down at the chess problem then seeing that winston s glass was empty he brought the gin bottle and filled it there was no need to give orders they knew his habits the chessboard was always waiting for him his corner table was always reserved even when the place was full he had it to himself since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him he never even bothered to count his drinks at irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill but he had the impression that they always undercharged him it would have made no difference if it had been the other way about he had always plenty of money nowadays he even had a job a sinecure more highly paid than his old job had been the music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over winston raised his head to listen no bulletins from the front however it was merely a brief announcement from the ministry of plenty in the preceding quarter it appeared the tenth threeyear plan s quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by per cent he examined the chess problem and set out the pieces it was a tricky ending involving a couple of knights white to play and mate in two moves winston looked up at the portrait of big brother white always mates he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism always without exception it is so arranged in no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won did it not symbolize the eternal unvarying triumph of good over evil the huge face gazed back at him full of calm power white always mates the voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone you are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen thirty fifteen thirty this is news of the highest importance take care not to miss it fifteen thirty the tinking music struck up again winston s heart stirred that was the bulletin from the front instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming all day with little spurts of excitement the thought of a smashing defeat in africa had been in and out of his mind he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swarming across the never broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of africa like a column of ants why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way the outline of the west african coast stood out vividly in his mind he picked up the white knight and moved it across the board there was the proper spot even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force mysteriously assembled suddenly planted in their rear cutting their comunications by land and sea he felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence but it was necessary to act quickly if they could get control of the whole of africa if they had airfields and submarine bases at the cape it would cut oceania in two it might mean anything defeat breakdown the redivision of the world the destruction of the party he drew a deep breath an extraordinary medley of feeling but it was not a medley exactly rather it was successive layers of feeling in which one could not say which layer was undermost struggled inside him the spasm passed he put the white knight back in its place but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem his thoughts wandered again almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table they can t get inside you she had said but they could get inside you what happens to you here is for ever o brien had said that was a true word there were things your own acts from which you could never recover something was killed in your breast burnt out cauterized out he had seen her he had even spoken to her there was no danger in it he knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to actually it was by chance that they had met it was in the park on a vile biting day in march when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind he was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him it struck him at once that she had changed in some ill defined way they almost passed one another without a sign then he turned and followed her not very eagerly he knew that there was no danger nobody would take any interest in him she did not speak she walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind they halted it was vilely cold the wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional dirty looking crocuses he put his arm round her waist there was no telescreen but there must be hidden microphones besides they could be seen it did not matter nothing mattered they could have lain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to his flesh froze with horror at the thought of it she made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm she did not even try to disengage herself he knew now what had changed in her her face was sallower and there was a long scar partly hidden by the hair across her forehead and temple but that was not the change it was that her waist had grown thicker and in a surprising way had stiffened he remembered how once after the explosion of a rocket bomb he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle which made it seem more like stone than flesh her body felt like that it occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been he did not attempt to kiss her nor did they speak as they walked back across the grass she looked directly at him for the first time it was only a momentary glance full of contempt and dislike he wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes they sat down on two iron chairs side by side but not too close together he saw that she was about to speak she moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig her feet seemed to have grown broader he noticed i betrayed you she said baldly i betrayed you he said she gave him another quick look of dislike sometimes she said they threaten you with something something you can t stand up to can t even think about and then you say don t do it to me do it to somebody else do it to so and so and perhaps you might pretend afterwards that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn t really mean it but that isn t true at the time when it happens you do mean it you think there s no other way of saving yourself and you re quite ready to save yourself that way you want it to happen to the other person you don t give a damn what they suffer all you care about is yourself all you care about is yourself he echoed and after that you don t feel the same towards the other person any longer no he said you don t feel the same there did not seem to be anything more to say the wind plastered their thin overalls against their bodies almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence besides it was too cold to keep still she said something about catching her tube and stood up to go we must meet again he said yes she said we must meet again he followed irresolutely for a little distance half a pace behind her they did not speak again she did not actually try to shake him off but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her he had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tube station but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable he was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree cafe which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment he had a nostalgic vision of his corner table with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin above all it would be warm in there the next moment not altogether by accident he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people he made a halfhearted attempt to catch up then slowed down turned and made off in the opposite direction when he had gone fifty metres he looked back the street was not crowded but already he could not distinguish her any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers perhaps her thickened stiffened body was no longer recognizable from behind at the time when it happens she had said you do mean it he had meant it he had not merely said it he had wished it he had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen a cracked and jeering note a yellow note came into it and then perhaps it was not happening perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound a voice was singing under the spreading chestnut tree i sold you and you sold me the tears welled up in his eyes a passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle he took up his glass and sniffed at it the stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank but it had become the element he swam in it was his life his death and his resurrection it was gin that sank him into stupor every night and gin that revived him every morning when he woke seldom before eleven hundred with gummed up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight through the midday hours he sat with glazed face the bottle handy listening to the telescreen from fifteen to closing time he was a fixture in the chestnut tree no one cared what he did any longer no whistle woke him no telescreen admonished him occasionally perhaps twice a week he went to a dusty forgotten looking office in the ministry of truth and did a little work or what was called work he had been appointed to a sub committee of a sub committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary they were engaged in producing something called an interim report but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out it was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets or outside there were four others on the committee all of them persons similar to himself there were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done but there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finished when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse with subtle haggling over definitions enormous digressions quarrels threats even to appeal to higher authority and then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes like ghosts fading at cock crow the telescreen was silent for a moment winston raised his head again the bulletin but no they were merely changing the music he had the map of africa behind his eyelids the movement of the armies was a diagram a black arrow tearing vertically southward and a white arrow horizontally eastward across the tail of the first as though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist his interest flagged again he drank another mouthful of gin picked up the white knight and made a tentative move check but it was evidently not the right move because uncalled a memory floated into his mind he saw a candle lit room with a vast white counterpaned bed and himself a boy of nine or ten sitting on the floor shaking a dice box and laughing excitedly his mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing it must have been about a month before she disappeared it was a moment of reconciliation when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived he remembered the day well a pelting drenching day when the water streamed down the window pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by the boredom of the two children in the dark cramped bedroom became unbearable winston whined and grizzled made futile demands for food fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall while the younger child wailed intermittently in the end his mother said now be good and i il buy you a toy a lovely toy you ll love it and then she had gone out in the rain to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of snakes and ladders he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard it was a miserable outfit the board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill cut that they would hardly lie on their sides winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again almost to the starting point they played eight games winning four each his tiny sister too young to understand what the game was about had sat propped up against a bolster laughing because the others were laughing for a whole afternoon they had all been happy together as in his earlier childhood he pushed the picture out of his mind it was a false memory he was troubled by false memories occasionally they did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were some things had happened others had not happened he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter he had started as though a pin had run into him a shrill trumpet call had pierced the air it was the bulletin victory it always meant victory when a trumpet call preceded the news a sort of electric drill ran through the cafe even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears the trumpet call had let loose an enormous volume of noise already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside the news had run round the streets like magic he could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened as he had foreseen a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy s rear the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din vast strategic manoeuvre perfect co ordination utter rout half a million prisoners complete demoralization control of the whole of africa bring the war within measurable distance of its end victory greatest victory in human history victory victory victory under the table winston s feet made convulsive movements he had not stirred from his seat but in his mind he was running swiftly running he was with the crowds outside cheering himself deaf he looked up again at the portrait of big brother the colossus that bestrode the world the rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain he thought how ten minutes ago yes only ten minutes there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat ah it was more than a eurasian army that had perished much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry of love but the final indispensable healing change had never happened until this moment the voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter but the shouting outside had died down a little the waiters were turning back to their work one of them approached with the gin bottle winston sitting in a blissful dream paid no attention as his glass was filled up he was not running or cheering any longer he was back in the ministry of love with everything forgiven his soul white as snow he was in the public dock confessing everything implicating everybody he was walking down the white tiled corridor with the feeling of walking in sunlight and an armed guard at his back the longhoped for bullet was entering his brain he gazed up at the enormous face forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache o cruel needless misunderstanding o stubborn self willed exile from the loving breast two gin scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose but it was all right everything was all right the struggle was finished he had won the victory over himself he loved big brother appendix the principles
